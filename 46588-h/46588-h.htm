<p class="chaptitle">A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE TRAVELERS'
CLUB.</p>


<p>"'Pears to me, Marse Jack, you done gone
been quiet long 'nuff dis spell," exclaimed Monday,
Jack Harkaway's colored servant, as he
entered his master's room at the hotel.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning in the month of October.</p>

<p>Jack Harkaway at the age of eighteen, well
supplied with money, had been leading an idle
life in London for some time.</p>

<p>This did not suit Monday's ideas at all.</p>

<p>Looking up from the newspaper he was reading,
Jack pushed back his curly hair from his
ample forehead and smiled.</p>

<p>"What would you like to be doing, my sable
friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know 'zactly that I'd like to do anything
in pertickler, Marse Jack, but dis chile
hasn't killed nobody lately."</p>

<p>"You must learn to curb your savage instincts,
Monday," said Harkaway. "But
this I may tell you. It is possible that we
shall be on the move sooner than you expect."</p>

<p>"Hooray! Golly, sah, dat's de good news, for
suah. I'se been afraid I'se gwine ter rust out,
'stead ob wear out."</p>

<p>"What have you got in your hand?"</p>

<p>"Ki! What hab I got? A letter. I misremember
dat I come in for somet'ing."</p>

<p>"Give it me."</p>

<p>Monday handed his master a letter and retired,
without venturing on any further remark.</p>

<p>The epistle was directed in a delicate lady's
hand and was highly perfumed.</p>

<p>Breaking the seal, Jack muttered: "From Lena
Van Hoosen. Wants to see me at once. Something
important to communicate. I'll go in half an hour.
Lucky it was not this evening, as I have a special
meeting of the Travelers' Club to attend."</p>

<p>Miss Lena Van Hoosen belonged to one of the
first families of New York city, and at nineteen
years of age was the prettiest and most accomplished
girl in London, which is saying a great
deal.</p>

<p>She had been making the tour of Europe with
her mother and father, and was resting awhile,
before returning to America. Jack had been
considerably struck with her grace and beauty,
paying her much attention, since his first introduction
to her at a ball.</p>

<p>He had every reason to believe that she also
thought very well of him.</p>

<p>Taking up his hat, he quitted the hotel, and
hiring a cab, was driven to Miss Van Hoosen's
residence in Belgravia.</p>

<p>She received him cordially.</p>

<p>"I sent for you, Mr. Harkaway, for a particular
reason," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied Jack. "Whatever the
reason may be, I feel very much indebted to
you for this mark of attention on your part."</p>

<p>"In the first place, we are going home next
week."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa has business to attend to and we
have already been absent nearly twelve
months."</p>

<p>"I regret that I shall lose your agreeable
society."</p>

<p>"The gap in the circle of your acquaintance,
which our going away will create," said Miss
Van Hoosen, "I have no doubt you will soon
supply."</p>

<p>"Not so easily as you imagine," he answered.</p>

<p>"But that is not all I wanted to see you
about," continued Miss Van Hoosen as her face
assumed a graver expression. "You are well
acquainted with Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>"Yes, his lordship is a member of the same
club as myself&mdash;the Travelers'. I have no
reason to believe that he likes me; in fact, a
coldness has always existed between us."</p>

<p>The young lady drew her chair closer to Jack.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "what I am going to tell
you, must be received in strict confidence."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"Yesterday, Lord Maltravers called upon me
and did me the honor to ask for my hand."</p>

<p>Jack's heart fluttered a little, for this was
more than he had ever dared to do.</p>

<p>"What answer did you give him?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"The same that I have given to others before
him."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Simply, that I have promised my parents
that I will neither engage myself to, or marry
any one, until I am twenty-one. Thereupon,
he most unjustifiably made use of your name."</p>

<p>"My name!"</p>

<p>"He said that he knew you were his rival,
and that I had refused him on your account; he
added that he would soon remove you from his
path and then he would urge his suit again."</p>

<p>Jack Harkaway was astonished at this revelation.</p>

<p>"He may have remarked that I admired you,
Miss Van Hoosen," he exclaimed. "But he was
quite unwarranted in saying what he did. If
he attempts to pick a quarrel with me, let him
beware."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I want you to avoid,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"No matter; the days of dueling are not yet
over. In France a man can seek satisfaction
for his wounded honor."</p>

<p>"Let me beg and pray of you, to keep away
from Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>"I can make no promise."</p>

<p>"Remember that people tell strange tales of
him. He has resided much in Italy and I have
heard that he keeps a Neapolitan assassin in his
pay."</p>

<p>Jack laughed heartily at this.</p>

<p>"I am not a child to be scared by such stories
as that," he answered. "But if it will relieve
your mind, I will undertake to be on my
guard."</p>

<p>This was all Miss Van Hoosen could obtain
from him, and she was very uneasy in her
mind, when he rose to take his leave. He was
much gratified with the result of his visit. For
Lord Maltravers he did not care a snap of the
fingers; but he was delighted to think that
Lena Van Hoosen thought enough of him to
send for and warn him of a danger which she
fancied he was menaced with.</p>

<p>When he left the house, he walked slowly toward
the club, where he knew he would meet
some of his friends.</p>

<p>In the reading-room he encountered Dick
Harvey, who had been his schoolmate and had
accompanied him in most of his wanderings by
sea and land.</p>

<p>In an arm-chair sat Professor Isaac Mole, his
old tutor, who was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"How do, Jack?" exclaimed Harvey. "You
see the professor is a little under the weather.
Will you come to the committee-room? The
meeting is convened for two o'clock and it is
nearly that now."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," replied Jack.</p>

<p>Why the Travelers' Club was called by that
name, no one had ever been able to discover.
Its members were men who knew nothing of
other countries, except what they read in
books.</p>

<p>The special meeting, on the present occasion,
had been called by Mr. Oldfoguey, the President,
to discuss the actual habitat of that noble
beast, the buffalo.</p>

<p>When Jack and Harvey entered the committee-room,
there were about a dozen members
present.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldfoguey called the meeting to order.</p>

<p>He was an elderly gentleman with a large
bald head; he wore spectacles and a bottle-green
coat with brass buttons.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, "you are assembled
here to-day, for the purpose of discussing
the actual location of the buffalo. I am of
opinion that this gigantic beast is to be found in
certain parts of Central Park, in New York
city, and I am told that it roams at will over
the plains of Jersey. It will be a valuable contribution
to science, if we can settle this vexed
question, and I invite the views of members on
the subject."</p>

<p>Captain Cannon, a stout, plethoric gentleman,
of a soldierly bearing, who had seen service in
the Rifle Brigade, and was noted among his
friends for being able to tell more wildly improbable
yarns than any one else, responded to
the call.</p>

<p>"The buffalo is a great fact," he exclaimed.
"When in Canada West with my regiment, I
got lost in the Hudson's Bay territory, and subsisted
for six months on buffalo-meat. As far
as I know, the buffalo is only found east of the
Missouri river, and is rapidly dying out. Buffaloes
are, to my certain knowledge, sir, used in
New York for drawing street cars. It is naturally
a beast of burden and very tame. When
in Montreal, I used to drive a buffalo to a sleigh;
he went well and was docile. The buffalo's
favorite food is peanuts; he will also thrive on
pop-corn."</p>

<p>The gallant captain sat down, after delivering
this remarkable contribution to natural history,
and Mr. Zebadiah Twinkle rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sir," he exclaimed, looking fiercely at the
President, "I rise to a point of order. There
are only twelve members present, and according
to by-law 27 it requires fifteen to make a
quorum."</p>

<p>Mr. Twinkle was tall and angular, and he
glared defiantly around him.</p>

<p>The character of Mr. Twinkle was a very remarkable
one. He was a gentleman of independent
means, who had retired rich from the
grocery business. His ambition was to be considered
a sporting character. He was a great
boaster, but when put to the test, generally collapsed
in a ludicrous manner. In fact he was in
common parlance a fraud and a blower, but he
caused great amusement to his friends.</p>

<p>The entrance at this moment of five additional
members of the club, effectually disposed of
Mr. Twinkle's point of order.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "Now that everything is
regular, I will proceed with my remarks. As
my worthy and gallant friend Captain Cannon
has stated, it is a fact that buffaloes exist in the
city of New York, for whenever the citizens of
that vast commercial metropolis go sleigh-riding,
they invariably take their buffaloes. The animal
is by no means ferocious, and is frequently
taught by the Indians of Manhattan Island to
follow them about like a dog."</p>

<p>Mr. Twinkle was followed by Jack, who could
not help smiling at the dense ignorance displayed
by the previous speakers.</p>

<p>"Mr. President and gentlemen of the Travelers'
Club," he exclaimed, "allow me to state
that the buffalo is a wild animal, which is
only to be found on the plains of the Far
West, where it ranges in herds in a savage
state. It may be found as far south-west as
Texas, and as far north as Montana."</p>

<p>"Is my veracity called in question?" cried
Captain Cannon.</p>

<p>"Am I an ignoramus?" asked Mr. Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Order, gentlemen!" said the President, rapping
the table.</p>

<p>"Allow me to make a suggestion," exclaimed
Harvey. "As there is such a diversity of opinion
about the buffalo, and the members of the
club seem to be very hazy about the land in
which he lives, I propose that a committee of&mdash;say
five&mdash;be appointed to go to America and
make a report."</p>

<p>This proposition was received with favor.</p>

<p>"Make it a substantive motion," said the
President, "and I will take the sense of the
meeting on it."</p>

<p>This was done, and the motion being put to
the vote, it was carried, <i>nem. con.</i></p>

<p>"Gentlemen," exclaimed Mr. Oldfoguey,
"the power of appointment belongs, I believe,
to me."</p>

<p>"It does, by virtue of the office you hold," replied
Mr. Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Then I appoint as members of this investigating
committee, Mr. Harkaway, Professor
Mole, Captain Cannon, and Mr. Twinkle, with
Mr. Harvey as Secretary, each gentleman paying
his own expenses. The committee will start
within a month for New York and report to us
once a week."</p>

<p>"On the subject of the buffalo?" asked Captain
Cannon.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>No objection was made to this, and those
named on the committee accepted the honor imposed
upon them.</p>

<p>Jack was willing enough to go to America, because
Miss Van Hoosen was also going to that
country, and he thought sufficiently well of her
to wish to enjoy her society.</p>

<p>When all was settled, the meeting adjourned,
and Jack went to apprise Mr. Mole of his selection
as one of the Buffalo Investigating Committee.</p>

<p>The professor was still sleeping calmly, but he
had attracted the attention of Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>This scion of the aristocracy was about twenty-five
years of age, very rich and extremely
haughty.</p>

<p>His father died when he was young. He was
educated by a private tutor who let him have
his way in everything. His mother doted on
and spoilt him.</p>

<p>Young, rich, titled, handsome, what wonder
was it, that he was arrogant and thought himself
cast in a superior mold to his fellow-creatures,
whom he despised and looked down upon.
Maltravers hated Jack Harkaway, in the first
place because Jack paid him no deference, and
secondly because he fancied Lena Van Hoosen
preferred the dashing Jack to himself.</p>

<p>Knowing that Professor Mole was a friend of
Jack's he lost no opportunity of insulting him.</p>

<p>Seeing him asleep, he twisted a piece of paper
into what boys call a 'jigger,' and lighting it
at both ends, placed it on the old man's nose.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a young man who
was his toady; his name was Simpkins, and in
consideration of many favors bestowed upon
him by Lord Maltravers, Simpkins was his
most devoted servant.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Simpkins, "what an excellent
joke; that will wake the old boy up."</p>

<p>"He's no right to sleep in a club, by Jove,"
remarked his lordship.</p>

<p>"Certainly not; it is not the proper place."</p>

<p>Presently the flame began to burn the skin of
the professor's nasal organ, and he awoke with
a cry of affright.</p>

<p>His hands instinctively sought his nose and
he pulled off the 'jigger.'</p>

<p>"Confound it," he exclaimed, "my face is
burnt. Who has done this?"</p>

<p>The two young men began to laugh loudly
and were evidently enjoying their practical
joke.</p>

<p>"I did it," said Lord Maltravers. "Is there
anything else you want to know?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mole regarded him with indignation.</p>

<p>"If I wasn't an old man, I would chastise you
for your insolence," he cried.</p>

<p>"Don't fall back on your age," replied Maltravers.
"I am here to take the consequences
of anything I may have done."</p>

<p>A quick step caused him to turn round.</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>It was Harkaway, who, standing in the doorway,
had been a silent spectator of the scene.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers folded his arms.</p>

<p>"I am ready to answer you, or any one else,"
he said.</p>

<p>The two men regarded one another sternly.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"THE DUEL ON THE SANDS."</p>


<p>Jack Harkaway was afraid of no man living,
and though averse to quarreling, he always
supported his friends.</p>

<p>"You have committed a gross outrage on Mr.
Mole!" he exclaimed; "and in his name, I demand
an apology."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" sneered Maltravers.</p>

<p>"And what is more, I mean to have it."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Apologize, my lord, or something may&mdash;nay,
will assuredly happen which both of us
will have cause to regret."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"You want, sir, what I do not feel inclined to
give you," replied Maltravers. "I am not in the
habit of apologizing to a gentleman, and should
not think of doing so to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"That is as much as to say that I am not a
gentleman," exclaimed Jack, the hot blood rushing
in a crimson tide to his face.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly at liberty to place
whatever construction you like on my words,
sir."</p>

<p>Simpkins smiled approval in his usual insipid
manner.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he lisped. "Very fine, indeed."</p>

<p>"I ask you once more," said Jack, "if you
will make the <i>amende honorable</i> to my friend?"</p>

<p>"And I distinctly refuse to do so."</p>

<p>"In that case I shall chastise you, as I would
any yelping cur which annoyed me in the street.
Mind yourself, my lord," Jack exclaimed.</p>

<p>He raised his fist and dealt Maltravers a blow
which the other vainly endeavored to ward
off.</p>

<p>His lordship fell heavily against the wall and
the blood flowed from a cut in his face, which
extended the whole length of the right cheek.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said Simpkins. "The man
is a butcher. He has marked you for life, Maltravers."</p>

<p>The latter applied a silk handkerchief to his
hurt, withdrawing it covered with the hot
blood.</p>

<p>"Coward!" he exclaimed. "You struck me
with a ring on your finger."</p>

<p>"Served you right," said Mr. Mole. "I wish
he had given you more of it. This will teach
you not to insult an old man, who never did you
any harm."</p>

<p>"I am not talking to you, imbecile," hissed
Maltravers.</p>

<p>He turned to his toady:</p>

<p>"Give me your arm, Simpkins," he added.</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure in life," was the reply.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me, Mr. Harkaway,"
continued Maltravers.</p>

<p>"Whenever you please," answered Jack, carelessly.</p>

<p>"I presume you will not refuse me the satisfaction
of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"You can rely upon me."</p>

<p>His lordship bowed stiffly, and, still holding
the handkerchief to the cut, from which the
blood trickled slowly, left the room.</p>

<p>"Am I much hurt, Simpkins?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Cut all to pieces."</p>

<p>"Shall I be disfigured?"</p>

<p>"You will always have a scar, I fear," replied
Simpkins.</p>

<p>"Curse that fellow!" cried Maltravers, between
his clenched teeth, "he shall pay a terrible
reckoning for this."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you hit him back again?"</p>

<p>"He took me by surprise, and he hit with such
force, that he knocked me out of time. My head
swims now and I am so dizzy, I feel as if I should
faint."</p>

<p>They passed out of the door, leaving Jack and
the professor together.</p>

<p>The latter shook Harkaway by the hand very
warmly.</p>

<p>"Many thanks, my dear fellow," he exclaimed.
"You acted very properly in punishing
that man. He has made a dead-set at me for
some time past."</p>

<p>"On my account; I know it all," replied Jack.
"This row was bound to come. I was warned
of it only this morning."</p>

<p>"Do you think he means to fight?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"And you will meet him?"</p>

<p>"I do not see how I can avoid it. No matter;
<i>vive la bagatelle</i>, as the French say. A life of
adventure for me."</p>

<p>Jack related to Mr. Mole the proceedings of
the club and the selection of a committee to
proceed to New York. In a short time Harvey
came in, and when told about the quarrel with
Lord Maltravers, gladly consented to act as his
second, if a challenge should be sent.</p>

<p>The law of England forbade dueling, but in
France, hostile meetings frequently took place,
and they did not doubt that the encounter
would be arranged for that country.</p>

<p>As the challenged party, Jack had the choice
of weapons and resolved to choose swords, as he
was an expert swordsman.</p>

<p>He invited the professor and Harvey to dine
with him at his hotel, intending to go to the
theater afterward, but this intention was frustrated
by the visit of Captain Cannon, who
sent up his card saying he wanted to see him on
urgent business.</p>

<p>Jack stepped into an inner room and at once
accorded him an interview.</p>

<p>"Very sorry to trouble you about an unpleasant
matter," said the captain. "But Lord Maltravers
has asked me to act as his friend."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Jack. "You have
heard all about this unfortunate business."</p>

<p>"Surely, and if a blow had not been struck
we could have arranged it. As it is, a meeting
must take place."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At Calais, by daybreak to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is useless to delay," replied the captain.
"The express train leaves at half-past
eight. Who is your second?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Harvey."</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall expect him at my hotel,
the Imperial, after our arrival. We will arrange
everything. It is all very simple. I
fought a dozen duels before I was your age and
always winged my man."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"Fact, I assure you. Keep your courage up."</p>

<p>"No fear of that," replied Jack. "I hope
your principal will be as calm as I am."</p>

<p>"Oh! he won't show the white feather," answered
Captain Cannon. "The Maltravers
blood may be bad, but there isn't an ounce of
cowardice in it. Good-by, we meet to-morrow."</p>

<p>Jack nodded, and seeing Captain Cannon out,
excused himself to Mr. Mole and sent for Monday,
to whom he confided the fact that he was
going to France to fight a duel.</p>

<p>"You fight a jewell, Marse Jack?" said Monday;
"what you want to do that for?"</p>

<p>"It is a point of honor. Don't you see? I
struck this man and must give him satisfaction."</p>

<p>"You leave him to me and I put six inches of
bowie-knife in him, for suah."</p>

<p>Monday's eyes gleamed like those of a cougar,
and it was clear that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>"Don't ever talk to me like that again," exclaimed
Jack. "I am no assassin."</p>

<p>By half-past eight, Jack and Harvey were
comfortably seated in a carriage of the mail
train on their way to France.</p>

<p>"If I fall," said Jack, "I want you to see Miss
Van Hoosen and tell her that my last thoughts
were of her."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," replied Harvey. "But I do not
think anything will happen to you."</p>

<p>They arrived in due course and Jack retired
to rest, while Harvey sought Captain Cannon
to arrange the preliminaries.</p>

<p>He found the captain drinking wine with
Lord Maltravers and talking loudly about the
exploits of his youth.</p>

<p>"Ah! Harvey," he exclaimed, "here you are.
Sit down and join us in the foaming goblet.
That's a good phrase I flatter myself. A duel
stirs my blood and carries me back a long way.
I recollect when I was quartered in Dublin, a
fiery young Hussar took exception to something
I said and threw a glass of wine in my face&mdash;he
did, by Jove, sir. That was a case of pistols for
two and a coffin for one. I met him in Ph&oelig;nix
Park the next day and at the first fire, I shot
him through the heart, and went to the expense
of having his body embalmed to send home to
his mother."</p>

<p>"Very considerate of you, I am sure," remarked
Harvey.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's just like me. I'm all heart. By
the way, what weapons does your principal select?"</p>

<p>"Swords."</p>

<p>"Humph! I'd rather it had been pistols, because
the affair would have been over sooner;
but no matter. I have an elegant pair of rapiers.
We will meet you at six o'clock on the
sands at low-water, one mile south of the
town."</p>

<p>"That is sufficient," answered Harvey.</p>

<p>He refused to spend the night in a spree as the
captain evidently intended to, and returned to
his own hotel.</p>

<p>At five o'clock he had Jack up, and they
sought the appointed spot, finding Lord Maltravers
and his second already there.</p>

<p>In an instant the principals stripped to their
shirts and grasped the weapons which were
handed them.</p>

<p>The swords were of highly tempered steel,
sharply pointed and as pliable as a willow
wand.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising in the east, gilding the
horizon with its burning rays. A few fishing-smacks
lay in the offing. The tide was on the
turn, and the wavelets plashed mournfully on
the sand, as if singing a requiem.</p>

<p>"<i>En garde</i>!" cried Maltravers.</p>

<p>Jack placed himself in position. His right
arm and knee advanced, and his left hand
by his side.</p>

<p>The swords clashed as they crossed each other,
and recovering, the duelists watched carefully
for an opening.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers lunged in <i>carte</i>, but his
thrust was delicately foiled by his opponent,
who parried it skillfully.</p>

<p>A long strip of plaster hid the cut on his lordship's
face, which was ghastly white and terribly
in earnest.</p>

<p>For some minutes they fenced with the adroitness
of veteran swordsmen, neither gaining the
slightest advantage, though a hectic spot which
appeared on Maltravers's face, indicated that
his mind was less at ease than Jack's.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack ceased to act on the defensive
and became the aggressor, breaking down his
lordship's guard and pinking him slightly in the
left arm.</p>

<p>"First blood!" said Harvey; "are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Confound it, no. This is a duel to the
death," replied Maltravers, his face distorted
with passion.</p>

<p>"As you please," replied Jack.</p>

<p>Again, they faced one another, the wounded
man having hastily tied a piece of his shirt
sleeve round his arm.</p>

<p>The swords clashed in the bright morning
sunshine, which every moment became brighter.</p>

<p>In vain Maltravers strove to injure his enemy.
Each thrust was parried and he panted
with exertion, while tears of impotent rage
started to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ha! I have you now," he exclaimed, as the
point of his rapier touched Jack's breast.</p>

<p>"Not quite," replied Jack, who threw himself
back, instantly recovered, and lunging in
<i>tierce</i>, sent his weapon through the left shoulder
of the nobleman.</p>

<p>Maltravers staggered; he leant upon his
sword, which snapped in half, and he sunk upon
his knees, his face convulsed with pain.</p>

<p>"That ends it," exclaimed the captain. "I
confess myself satisfied."</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried his lordship, seizing the
pointed end of his rapier and binding a kerchief
round the broken part so as to hold it more
securely.</p>

<p>"Surely, you will fight no more?"</p>

<p>"I will fight till I drop."</p>

<p>Harkaway broke his sword in half over his
knee and grasped the narrow end, in the same
manner as his adversary.</p>

<p>"I am willing," he replied.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," remonstrated Harvey,
"are you insane?"</p>

<p>"By no means," was the calm and confident
reply. "I did not come here to play, and besides,
I hate to leave my work half finished."</p>

<p>"Eh! the wretch," said Maltravers, bursting
with rage, "he mocks me; but we shall see."</p>

<p>Jack sunk on his knees in front of Maltravers,
and they were now so near, that their eyes returned
flash for flash and their hot breath fanned
each other's face.</p>

<p>Maltravers was bleeding profusely, his blood
dropping on the thirsty sand, which greedily
sucked up the ruby fluid, and the ghastly pallor
of his face deepened.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he had succeeded in inflicting
a few scratches upon his adversary and he
grated his teeth with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>This irritated Jack, who precipitated matters,
by receiving the point of his lordship's weapon
in his left arm and throwing himself upon him,
piercing his breast and bearing him to the
ground.</p>

<p>Now Maltravers could utter no protest, for he
fainted and extended himself on the ground in
the attitude of a corpse.</p>

<p>Jack hurriedly put on his coat.</p>

<p>He was bleeding, but in the excitement of the
moment felt no inconvenience, and it was not
till his wound stiffened that he knew he was
hurt. They began to leave the spot.</p>

<p>"Look here," said the captain, "this is contrary
to all precedent. I recollect when I
fought the major of the Twenty-seventh, and
left him for dead, we sent a coach after him and
a doctor."</p>

<p>"All right," responded Harvey, "we will do
that for you."</p>

<p>He departed hastily with Harkaway, and the
captain dragged the insensible body of Maltravers
to a spot further inland, where the rapidly
advancing waves could not touch it.</p>

<p>For the next hour he busied himself in
stanching the blood, which indeed was the only
way of saving the defeated man's life. At the
expiration of that time he perceived a carriage
driving furiously along the sand.</p>

<p>When it reached the spot where the captain
was standing a gentleman stepped out.</p>

<p>"I am the doctor," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Cannon nodded, and after a brief examination
the medical man ordered Maltravers
to be driven to the hotel.</p>

<p>For some hours he hovered between life and
death.</p>

<p>The captain remained in constant attendance
by the bedside, until a severe attack of fever
supervened, when a professional nurse was hired.</p>

<p>On the third day the crisis came.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the doctor left the sick
man's room and sought the captain.</p>

<p>"Has this gentleman any friends?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, in England," was the reply.</p>

<p>"It will be best to send for them without delay."</p>

<p>"Is the case so grave as that?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer for the result," replied the
doctor.</p>

<p>Captain Cannon at once telegraphed to Lady
Maltravers, the mother of the sick man.</p>

<p>That night the patient was very feverish and
restless; he recognized no one.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the following day Lady
Maltravers arrived at the hotel accompanied by
Bambino, his lordship's Italian servant.</p>

<p>This fellow had a most villainous countenance
and it was said that he had been condemned to
the galleys for a term of years, in expiation of
some terrible crime.</p>

<p>"My son! Where is my son?" demanded Lady
Maltravers.</p>

<p>She was conducted to his room and from that
time forth watched over him with all a mother's
devotion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE ASSASSIN AT WORK.</p>


<p>Thanks to his youth, aided, by a strong
and vigorous constitution, Lord Maltravers
passed through the valley of the shadow of
death without succumbing to the fell destroyer.</p>

<p>In a fortnight he was out of danger.</p>

<p>The doctor predicted that his recovery would
be slow, and advised that he should remain
where he was until his strength was fully established.</p>

<p>Lady Maltravers returned to London, rejoicing
that her child was saved to her, for with all
his faults she loved him with the strong intensity
of a fond and over-indulgent mother.</p>

<p>Consequently his lordship remained at Calais
in the charge of his faithful valet, Bambino.</p>

<p>One day, while sitting up for the first time,
his pale and haggard face brought into prominence
by the rays of the sun which streamed in
through the open window, he received a letter
from Simpkins, to whom he had written for
news.</p>

<p>In this letter he was informed that Harkaway
and four friends were about to depart for New
York in a few days on board the steamer Erin,
Miss Van Hoosen having preceded them by a
week.</p>

<p>"Bambino," exclaimed his lordship.</p>

<p>"Signor," replied the valet, who glided softly
to his side, with the noiseless motion of a black
snake.</p>

<p>"Three years ago, when I was in Florence, a
man named Bambino was being tried for the
commission of a double murder. He had killed
the woman he was about to marry and a man
of whom he was jealous. The trial excited
great interest; and finally, being found guilty,
Bambino was condemned to the galleys for the
term of his natural life."</p>

<p>The Italian raised his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"That was in the past, master," he said.</p>

<p>"True; but it is necessary that I should recall
it. I took an interest in you, visiting you
in prison before your transportation to the
coast to begin your life-long slavery. I wanted
just such a man as yourself."</p>

<p>"You have ever found me grateful, signor."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me. You swore by your
faith that if I procured your release, your life
should be mine to dispose of, as I thought fit.
By expending large sums in bribing your
jailers, I contrived that you should escape, and
since then you have lived a life of comparative
ease and luxury."</p>

<p>"It is true," exclaimed Bambino.</p>

<p>"The time has how arrived when I want you
to exercise your peculiar talents on my behalf."</p>

<p>"You have but to command, my lord," replied
the Italian. "It is for me to obey."</p>

<p>"Good. You have seen Mr. Harkaway?"</p>

<p>"I know him well."</p>

<p>"Again, good," exclaimed Maltravers, whose
dark eyes flashed vindictively. "Harkaway is
my enemy!"</p>

<p>"He shall die," said Bambino, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Very well. It is for you to see to that. I
am in the position you see me now, through that
man. He starts for New York on Saturday in
the steamer Erin, following a lady I love,
whom he intends to steal from me and marry,
if I do not stop him. You will embark on the
same vessel, and by the time I am well enough
to join you in New York, you will have rendered
a good account of him."</p>

<p>"His spirit shall have gone to the land of
shades. I, Bambino, swear it," said the Italian.</p>

<p>"I rely on you. Is it requisite for me to say
anything more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my lord."</p>

<p>"Then take what money you want and be
off," returned Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>That night Bambino was on his way to Liverpool,
from which port the steamer started.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ADÃ‰LE.</p>


<p>Lord Maltravers was reading a book when
the door opened and a beautiful girl with long
silky dark hair entered the room.</p>

<p>Her face was sad, and there were traces of
tears on her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Springing forward, she threw herself on her
knees before him, and seizing his hand, which
she covered with kisses, exclaimed, in pathetic
tones, "Oh! Arthur, at last I have found
you."</p>

<p>"AdÃ©le!" he said, while a hectic flush mantled
his cheek.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "It is your own AdÃ©le,
the little girl you vowed to love; AdÃ©le whom
you married two years ago in the little French
village in the <i>Pas de Calais</i>. Oh, Arthur! how
could you desert me?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never married you," he answered, stammering
a little.</p>

<p>"Indeed you did."</p>

<p>"It was a mock marriage."</p>

<p>"The good <i>curÃ©</i> who united us is alive. He
will bear evidence that I am your wife. I,
AdÃ©le Bellefontaine, am in reality Lady Maltravers."</p>

<p>"It is false."</p>

<p>"Oh! do not repudiate me, for, darling, I love
you," she pleaded. "If you have forgotten me,
I can never forget you."</p>

<p>"How did you find me out?"</p>

<p>"I read an account of your duel in the papers;
they said you were ill and suffering; I
walked fifty miles to come and nurse you, because
I was too poor to ride."</p>

<p>"You shall have money to go home again,
foolish girl," said Maltravers.</p>

<p>"I do not want it. All I ask is your love,"
replied AdÃ©le. "Let me have the sweet privilege
of waiting upon you, Arthur. I will be
your servant, your slave. Do not, for heaven's
sake, drive me from you."</p>

<p>Maltravers was ill at ease and could not disguise
his agitation.</p>

<p>Two years before, as the poor girl had truly
said, he had met her in a secluded village, where
he was fishing. He had married the poor peasant
girl and then basely deserted her.</p>

<p>Some letters he left behind revealed his true
name, and at the first chance AdÃ©le had come to
him, to beg once more for that love for which
she was pining.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to acknowledge
her claim or recognize her before his friends,
and for a moment he did not know what to
do.</p>

<p>His mind, however, was soon made up; he
would threaten her, deny her story, and drive
her from him.</p>

<p>"Rise," he exclaimed; "you are an impudent
impostor. If you do not instantly quit this
room I will have you arrested. It is the correctional
tribunal which should deal with such creatures
as you."</p>

<p>AdÃ©le rose to her feet and clasped her head
with her hands as if her throbbing brain would
burst.</p>

<p>Could she believe the evidence of her senses?</p>

<p>"My God!" she cried. "He sends me away!
Does he not know that I have a heart which will
break? Are a man's vows traced upon the sand
or written in water when he tells a woman he
loves her?"</p>

<p>"Go," continued Maltravers, sternly.</p>

<p>For a minute she was completely overwhelmed
and stood like one in a dream.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go," she said in a choked voice.
"Heaven knows whither! The folks in my village
shall never see me again, or know my
shame. I said I would go after my husband
and bring him back. My father and mother
were to prepare a <i>fÃªte</i>. That is over. I have
been gathering Dead Sea fruit. It has turned to
dust in my hand. I trusted a bad man and my
punishment is more than I can bear. Yet, the
water is near, and there is one refuge for the
weary and heart-broken. Farewell, Arthur.
May God forgive you, as does your AdÃ©le."</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Maltravers's face moved. He
stared coldly at this poor girl whom he had
wronged so infamously and there was an aristocratic
sneer on his well-cut lip.</p>

<p>She staggered rather than walked to the door.
She descended the stairs like one dazed. The
iron had entered into her soul, and those hearts
which have been seared by the burning hand of
misfortune can alone sympathize with her.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le gained the street. Mechanically she
sought the harbor and entered upon the broad
pathway of the long pier. There was a wild
desperation in her eyes; her face was lighted up
with a half-insane gleam; no tears came to her
relief. At times a choking sob broke in her
throat&mdash;this was the only evidence of feeling
that she gave vent to.</p>

<p>A drizzling rain was falling which kept away
the usual promenaders on the pier. The tide
was flood and several vessels were sailing out of
the harbor.</p>

<p>She paid no attention to anything, seeming to
be absorbed in her misery. Her eyes became
fixed and glassy. Occasionally she moaned as
if in pain, and pressed her hand to her side to
still the beating of her heart.</p>

<p>When the end of the pier was reached, she
stopped, raised her eyes to heaven and her lips
moved as if in silent prayer.</p>

<p>Then she sprung lightly over the parapet and
fell into the foaming sea, whose waves were
beating in clouds of spray against the wooden
supports of the pier.</p>

<p>A large merchantman was passing out of the
harbor at the time with all sails set, and the
rash act of the poor suicide was witnessed by the
sailors on the deck.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation one gallant
fellow jumped overboard and swam toward the
drowning girl.</p>

<p>He succeeded in reaching her as she was about
to sink, and held her up, until a boat from his
ship came to her rescue.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le and her brave preserver were picked up
and conveyed to the vessel, she being in a dead
faint.</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed the sailor, as his
eyes fell more closely upon the girl's features.
"It is AdÃ©le Bellefontaine, from my
village of St. Ange, just as sure as my
name is Jacques Belot and she was the only
girl I ever loved, until she married that
scoundrelly Englishman, who deserted her.
If it had not been for AdÃ©le, here, I should
never have gone to sea."</p>

<p>"What are we to do with her?" asked the
captain. "The wind and tide are against us
and it is bad luck to put back."</p>

<p>"Take her with us, captain," said Jacques,
who was a fine, handsome young sailor.</p>

<p>"It is bad luck to have a would-be suicide on
board," remarked the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Ah! bah! you old croaker," replied Jacques.
"How do you know the girl intended to kill
herself?"</p>

<p>"I saw her deliberately jump into the sea."</p>

<p>"And I saw her blown over the side of the
pier, by the wind."</p>

<p>The sailors laughed at this sally, which encouraged
Jacques. "Won't you take her to
New York, captain?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the captain, good-naturedly,
"I suppose I may as well. She will be a companion
to my wife. Carry her below, friend
Jacques, but mind you don't get so dazzled
by the girl's pretty eyes, as to neglect your
duty. Take her away."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," answered Jacques, who raised
AdÃ©le's slender form in his arms and transported
her to the captain's cabin.</p>

<p>The skipper's wife was glad of a companion
and at once proceeded to restore her to consciousness,
while Jacques related the affair.</p>

<p>When AdÃ©le opened her eyes she looked wildly
around her and murmured: "Is this death?"</p>

<p>"No, deary," replied the captain's wife,
"this is life. You were saved by Jacques
here."</p>

<p>"Oh! let me die."</p>

<p>"What for, child? You are young and
pretty. Life should have its charms for you."</p>

<p>"I have seen him and he drove me from him.
He says I have no claim on him and threatened
me with the police. Oh! it has broken my
heart."</p>

<p>She burst into a paroxysm of bitter tears, but
they relieved the overcharged fountains of her
soul.</p>

<p>"It will do her good," exclaimed her kind
protectress.</p>

<p>Jacques Belot gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p>"She said 'he' and she has seen him," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
muttered. "I know what it means well
enough. That vile Englishman has gone back
on her. I have seen him, I can recall his face
like a book. He is a lord, they say; his name is
Maltravers. You see I forget nothing. We
shall meet one day, and it seems to me that
there will be a little account for me to square
with Mr. Englishman&mdash;<i>sacrÃ©-e-e</i>!"</p>

<p>Presently AdÃ©le recognized Jacques, and
greeted him as an old friend, but not as a former
lover.</p>

<p>To him and the captain's wife she related her
story, gaining much sympathy from them.</p>

<p>"Forget this milor'," said the captain's wife.</p>

<p>"Impossible," rejoined AdÃ©le.</p>

<p>"He is unworthy of you. Go to America and
marry this brave fellow who loves you and has
saved your life."</p>

<p>AdÃ©le shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"Madame," she replied, "though I am deserted,
I cannot fail to recollect that I am the
legal wife of Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>"At least promise that you will not again attempt
to commit suicide."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>With that they were obliged to be content and
so the good ship <i>Notre Dame de Calais</i> sailed
along the English Channel and out into the
storms of the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE VOYAGE.</p>


<p>Some days afterward the ocean steamship
Erin started from Liverpool, having on board,
among others, Jack Harkaway and his friends,
and Signor Bambino, an Italian gentleman, who
stated that he was proceeding to New York on
business of a commercial nature.</p>

<p>Jack and Harvey took no interest whatever
in the absurd question about the buffalo,
which agitated the quidnuncs of the Travelers'
Club.</p>

<p>The reason Jack was going to New York was
simple enough; he wanted to be where Miss Van
Hoosen was; and Harvey went because his friend
Jack did.</p>

<p>After the first sensations inseparable from a
sea-voyage were overcome, the saloon passengers
began to fraternize, and among the most
popular in the smoking-room was Signor Bambino.</p>

<p>Four days after leaving Liverpool, the Erin
encountered severe weather; the decks were
swept by the sea fore and aft, and for six hours
the hatches were battened down. When the
storm ceased, the passengers came on deck
once more and enjoyed the calm of the evening.</p>

<p>Jack and Bambino played eucher until midnight,
when the Italian threw down the cards.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of it, if it is all the same
to you," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But you have lost heavily," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Bah! what is that? to-day we lose, to-morrow
we win. It is only a trifle, after all."</p>

<p>"As you please," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Let us take a stroll on deck," continued the
Italian.</p>

<p>"With all my heart."</p>

<p>They quitted the saloon and went on deck,
which the quick eye of Bambino saw was deserted.</p>

<p>A thick mist had arisen, and though the captain
was on the bridge his form could not be distinguished.</p>

<p>The phosphorescent pathway in the wake of
the big ship gleamed and scintillated.</p>

<p>"How beautiful," remarked Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Bambino. "It looks like a sea
of fire. One might walk on it."</p>

<p>"I should not like to try," Jack said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Suppose you do make the effort."</p>

<p>At these words of Bambino, Jack turned half
round sharply, and faced him squarely.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Precisely what I say," rejoined Bambino.</p>

<p>They were standing at the stern of the ship,
right behind the wheel-house.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what do you want of
me?" inquired Jack, who became suspicious.</p>

<p>"I have a fancy to throw you into the sea."</p>

<p>"Madman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like. I am peculiar at times.
Come! how do you like the look of this?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Bambino drew a long knife and
made a thrust with it at Harkaway.</p>

<p>The latter stepped back quickly, receiving the
point of the knife in the fleshy part of his right
arm.</p>

<p>It was merely a graze and did not cause him
any serious inconvenience, but it served to put
him on his guard.</p>

<p>Being unarmed himself, he concluded that his
best course would be to grapple with his assailant,
which he accordingly did, dashing the knife
from his grasp by a lucky hit and placing himself
more on an equality with the cowardly assassin.</p>

<p>The struggle that ensued was short, sharp and
decisive, for the superior strength of the robust
Englishman soon told on the effeminate Italian,
who, deprived of his knife, was not very dangerous.</p>

<p>Jack threw him on the deck and pinned him
by the throat.</p>

<p>"Villain," he cried, "what was your object
in attacking me?"</p>

<p>Bambino made no answer.</p>

<p>"Tell me," continued Jack, "or I'll strangle
the life out of you!"</p>

<p>He compressed his fingers mere tightly and
the assassin's eyes started from their sockets,
while his face assumed a purple hue.</p>

<p>"Speak, speak!" persisted Jack.</p>

<p>A gurgling sound came from the man's
mouth, and he made signs that he was being
stifled.</p>

<p>When the gripe was slightly relaxed he said:
"I am a poor adventurer, and fancied I could
get money by robbing you."</p>

<p>"That is not the truth; robbery was not your
object, but murder."</p>

<p>"Well, I will confess," exclaimed Bambino,
who was afraid of being killed and thought he
could serve his employer better alive than
dead.</p>

<p>"Make haste."</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers ordered me to kill you.
I am simply a hired assassin. Let me live."</p>

<p>All was instantly clear to Jack.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," he replied.</p>

<p>"You will let me go, now?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I will do nothing of the kind. I
must make you a prisoner for my own protection,
and when we reach New York the authorities
will decide what is to be done with you."</p>

<p>It was in vain for Bambino to protest; he submitted
to his fate in sullen silence, allowing
himself to be dragged amidship, when Jack explained
to the first officer what had happened.</p>

<p>The watch was called, and the would-be murderer,
gnashing his teeth at the failure of his attempt,
was taken below and confined.</p>

<p>The next morning Jack appeared at breakfast
in the saloon as if nothing had happened, but he
told Mr. Mole and Harvey that an emissary of
Lord Maltravers had attempted his life.</p>

<p>"This is very important," observed the professor.
"It shows to what lengths Maltravers
will go to remove you from his path. Let the
man's full confession be taken; he can then be
used as a means for the arrest of his lordship,
who, if I am right in my law, can be sent to
prison, as the fellow's accomplice."</p>

<p>"Certainly, he can," replied Harvey.</p>

<p>"It is not very pleasant," remarked Jack, "to
know that an enemy is plotting against you in a
far-off country and sending out men to kill
you."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," said Mole.</p>

<p>"Something novel for you, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! no. This old head has been prolific in
its time. Let us form ourselves into the Jack
Harkaway guard."</p>

<p>"Splendid idea," cried Harvey. "I volunteer
for the service. You and I will arm ourselves
and one or both of us will be with him, night and
day."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Jack, much touched at this
proof of the devotion or his friends, "it is unnecessary."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," answered Mole, "I am
sure that this attempt will be followed by others."</p>

<p>"Well! If you insist upon it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We do," said both the professor and Harvey
in chorus.</p>

<p>Jack shook their hands in token of gratitude,
and as Mr. Mole had brought out a small arsenal
of pistols and knives in his trunk, for use in an
emergency, he promptly armed both himself
and Harvey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack remained on deck.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man on the look-out reported a
sail to leeward.</p>

<p>The steamer altered her course and made directly
for the vessel, as she showed signals of
distress and appeared to be in a water-logged
condition.</p>

<p>When near enough the captain ordered the
engines to be stopped and a boat lowered.</p>

<p>This was done and a crew manned the boat to
row to the distressed craft.</p>

<p>An event like this relieved the monotony of a
sea voyage and the deck was soon crowded with
passengers.</p>

<p>In half an hour the crew had rowed to the vessel
and returned without boarding her.</p>

<p>They reported that the ship was leaking badly
and had been abandoned by her crew, after
suffering severely from the late storm.</p>

<p>Her masts had all gone by the side; her sails
were blown to rags; her bulwarks were stove in.
She was rudderless and it was a wonder how
she kept afloat.</p>

<p>When this was reported and the boat hauled
up to the davits once more, the captain of the
steamer ordered the engineer to go ahead, and
proceeded on his course.</p>

<p>He felt that he had done all that humanity required
of him.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the dull, heavy beat of the enormous
engines made themselves heard in the vibrating
ship than a commotion was seen in the
forecastle.</p>

<p>Jack ran forward to ascertain the cause.</p>

<p>A man was seen struggling fiercely with the
sailors, who were trying to detain him.</p>

<p>It was Bambino.</p>

<p>By some means, while the steamer was lying
to, he had contrived to escape from the place
in which he was confined.</p>

<p>"Stop him!" cried Jack. "Knock him down,
he is dangerous."</p>

<p>Bambino, however, was too much for his opponents,
and dashing them on one side, made a
flying leap and sprung over the side into the
sea.</p>

<p>Whether he dived like a duck or was sucked
under the ship and struck by one of the flanges
of the screw, it was difficult to tell.</p>

<p>He was looked for in all directions. The
steamer was again stopped and the boat lowered,
but nothing could be seen of the man overboard.</p>

<p>"He is gone to his last account," said the
captain, "and he is no loss."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have had him live," replied Jack,
to whom this remark was addressed, "and
somehow, I can't quite make up my mind that
the fellow was born to be drowned."</p>

<p>"Hanging is certainly more in his line."</p>

<p>"That is so," said Jack.</p>

<p>The steamer once more proceeded on her way,
and Jack amused himself by scanning the expanse
of ocean, through an opera-glass.</p>

<p>He fancied he saw a dark object resembling a
man struggling with the waves in the vicinity
of the abandoned vessel.</p>

<p>It was quickly left behind, and thinking it
might have been his imagination, he dismissed
Bambino from his mind.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE ABANDONED SHIP.</p>


<p>The crafty Italian, however; was not so easily
disposed of.</p>

<p>He was perfectly at home in the water, and
had, by diving, kept himself concealed from
view, his intention being to swim toward the
abandoned vessel, which he had seen as soon as
he came on deck.</p>

<p>He knew that a long term of imprisonment
awaited him, if he was taken to New York, and
he deemed any risk, no matter how desperate,
preferable to that fate.</p>

<p>This decided him in jumping overboard.</p>

<p>In time, he succeeded in reaching the water-logged
ship, which rolled uneasily upon the
heaving bosom of the deep.</p>

<p>Climbing up the chains, he got on board and
found himself the sole master of a fine vessel.</p>

<p>She was partly laden with timber, which accounted
for her keeping afloat, in the disabled
condition in which she was.</p>

<p>His first task was to examine her cabins,
which were free from water.</p>

<p>In the forecastle he found everything in disorder,
as if the vessel had been abandoned in a
hurry and without sufficient cause.</p>

<p>Probably the ship was overwhelmed by the
fury of the storm in the dead of night, and the
crew, seized with a panic, had lowered the
boats.</p>

<p>Her figure-head had been washed away and
the name on her stern was not decipherable.</p>

<p>Bambino could only make out the letters,
"v&mdash;r&mdash;e&mdash;a&mdash;n&mdash;d&mdash;ris."</p>

<p>Going aft, he descended the companion-ladder,
and entered the captain's cabin, where the
same indications of haste were noticeable as in
the forecastle.</p>

<p>Everything had been thrown about in reckless
confusion, and many articles of value were
piled up, as if to be carried away.</p>

<p>In various lockers he found provisions in
plenty, unharmed by the saltwater. Cans of
meats, sardines, biscuits and fruits, as well as
bottles of wine, brandy and beer.</p>

<p>His spirits rose at this timely discovery, and
his elation increased as he reflected that the ship
would keep afloat for some time, unless engulfed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
by another storm, of which there was no indication
at present.</p>

<p>Sitting down, he placed on the table of the
cabin an excellent repast, of which he partook
with a good appetite, washing it down with
copious draughts of wine.</p>

<p>His satisfaction culminated when he found a
box of fine cigars, which he promptly began to
smoke, a box of matches affording him all the
light he wanted.</p>

<p>While he was congratulating himself upon his
good luck, he heard a peculiar sound.</p>

<p>This came from what appeared to be an inner
cabin, the door of which was locked.</p>

<p>The sound resembled the moaning of some
human being in deep anguish.</p>

<p>Somewhat superstitious, Bambino crossed himself
and muttered a prayer.</p>

<p>Again the sound was repeated.</p>

<p>Bambino's hair began to erect itself, and he
advanced to the partition, inclining his head in
a listening position.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MYSTERY OF THE DESERTED VESSEL.</p>


<p>After listening at the partition for some
time Bambino became convinced that a human
being was confined in an inner cabin.</p>

<p>Frequently he heard sobs and groans mingled
with exclamations in the French language, with
which he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>A further examination showed him a door,
against which several pieces of furniture were
jammed, they having evidently been thrown
against it during the progress of the storm.</p>

<p>This had effectually prevented the egress of
the unfortunate person inside.</p>

<p>Being a powerful man, the Italian exerted
himself to the utmost and succeeded in removing
a bureau, some chairs and a heavy table
which were piled up in confusion.</p>

<p>Then the door flew open, and he beheld a lady
lying on a bed, and it was easily observable that
she was in a state of complete exhaustion, having
been many days without food.</p>

<p>Had not help come when it did, she could not
have survived much longer.</p>

<p>Though the face was very beautiful, the
cheeks were sunken, emaciated and hollow; her
long silken hair hung in disheveled masses over
her shoulders, and in her deeply expressive eyes
there was the glare of incipient insanity.</p>

<p>No sooner did the girl see Bambino than she
endeavored to rise, but was compelled to fall
back again by weakness.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, tenderly.</p>

<p>"I am an angel now," she replied. "Death
has held me in his arms. I do not suffer any
more, though it was hard and bitter to die."</p>

<p>Her voice was faint and feeble. There was
that in her words and manner which indicated
that her mind was wandering. Reason had tottered
on its throne, until it had finally given
way beneath the weight of her sufferings.</p>

<p>Seeing that she was in want of nourishment,
he procured some food which he administered
with a spoon, afterward compelling her to drink
some wine.</p>

<p>Toward night she improved considerably, and
fell into a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>Bambino went repeatedly on deck to look out
for a sail, but did not see one.</p>

<p>His position was a precarious one, for should
another storm arise, there was little doubt the
vessel would either capsize or break her back.</p>

<p>He drew some consolation from the fact that
he was in the path of the steamships which were
constantly crossing and recrossing the Atlantic
ocean.</p>

<p>Two days passed, during which the lady remained
in a comatose state; but, as he continued
to feed her at intervals, she gradually
regained her strength, and on the third day was
able to get up and converse.</p>

<p>Her mind, however, was gone. She talked incoherently,
persisting that she had died during
the storm, and that she was a spirit.</p>

<p>"When I was alive," she would say, "I lived
in France and I married an English nobleman.
When he dies and comes to the land of spirits,
he will not deny that I am his wife, though on
earth, he drove me from him and broke my
heart."</p>

<p>"What was his name?" asked Bambino, who
became interested in her random utterings, he
scarcely knew why.</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers; you see I remember that,
though I cannot recollect all things that happened
before I died. I was called AdÃ©le."</p>

<p>Bambino started and visibly changed color.</p>

<p>He had heard his master speak of this girl,
and it appeared to him that he had made an important
discovery.</p>

<p>Maltravers had admitted to this confidential
villain that he had legally married the girl, and
he hoped that she was dead, as she might give
him some trouble if she lived.</p>

<p>Slave as he was, bound hand and foot to his
titled master, Bambino felt that, with this girl
in his possession, he would have a powerful
weapon to use, should he ever come into open
conflict with him.</p>

<p>He determined to say that she was his sister
and that the captain and crew of the ship had
left them behind in their hurry to quit, while he
could easily add that AdÃ©le had become crazed
with terror.</p>

<p>A week went by; and though AdÃ©le grew
stronger, there was no amelioration in her mental
condition.</p>

<p>She was quiet and even childish. Never did
she utter any threats against Lord Maltravers.
She loved him in a sweet, innocent way that was
very affecting.</p>

<p>In a locket, which she wore around her neck,
she had a faded photograph of the handsome,
bad man, who had made her the plaything of an
idle hour and ruined her young life. This she
would take from her bosom where she concealed
it and kiss with the greatest rapture, pressing
her lips to it and murmuring words of purest affection
and despairing love.</p>

<p>It was a sight to make the hardest heart feel,
and bring tears to the eyes of the most callous
man of the world.</p>

<p>Even Bambino, wretch that he was, had
known what it was to love, and he sighed for
her misery.</p>

<p>At length the wished-for sail hove in sight,
and the Italian contrived to attract the attention
of the crew, who lowered a boat to come to
their rescue.</p>

<p>He went below and roused AdÃ©le, who was
bending over the photograph of the loved one,
very much as a little child plays with a pretty
toy.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>mio caro</i>," he exclaimed, "we are
going on board another ship, which will take us
to a great city. Put that thing away."</p>

<p>AdÃ©le held up the picture, while a smile overspread
her countenance.</p>

<p>"Isn't he lovely?" she asked.</p>

<p>Bambino set his lips firmly together, while the
dark eyes&mdash;peculiar to the Latin race&mdash;flashed
forth their fire.</p>

<p>"I can't say anything against him," he replied,
"for I owe him much; but, <i>cospetto</i>! you
and he will go to different places when you die."</p>

<p>"I am dead. You know that," said the simple-minded
girl. "But will he not come to me
in time and ask my pardon? Will he not fold
me in his arms as of old and call me his darling?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said she, as her eyes rolled in an
ecstasy of unbounded affection. "It must be
so. There <i>must</i> be some recompense for the
pure in heart, hereafter."</p>

<p>Bambino was touched.</p>

<p>He patted her beautiful hair with the air of
an affectionate brother.</p>

<p>"Would to God, my child," he said, "that I
had won your love instead of the woman's who&mdash;but
no matter; my hand is red with her
blood."</p>

<p>AdÃ©le looked at him in dread surprise.</p>

<p>"Did you kill her?" she asked.</p>

<p>Bambino laughed, in a harsh, metallic tone.</p>

<p>"She is dead," he replied. "Ay, and&mdash;<i>Corpo
di Baccho</i>! the man is in the grave, too."</p>

<p>"Man! what man?" inquired AdÃ©le.</p>

<p>"Ask me no more questions, unless you want
to madden me," cried Bambino. "I thought
the wound was cicatrized, but you, with your
childish questions, set my blood on fire. I
loved that woman."</p>

<p>"Maltravers loved me once, yet I did not kill
him when he deserted me and afterward drove
me from him, when I laid my heart at his feet.
How can you kill those you love?"</p>

<p>Bambino could say no more. He led AdÃ©le
gently but firmly up the companion-ladder, and
in a few minutes the boat from the steamer was
alongside.</p>

<p>They were taken off the ship. He told his
story and excited much sympathy, especially
when he reached the vessel, which was bound
to New York.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le and he were given berths in the intermediate
part of the ship, which is amidships,
and in five days they found themselves in New
York.</p>

<p>Bambino was careful to conceal his right
name, as he knew the log would be published in
the papers, and might reach Harkaway's eye.</p>

<p>The Italian resolved to keep AdÃ©le in his
charge, as a counterfoil to any ill-treatment he
might receive from Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>When the steamer arrived, he went to a hotel
and having secured attendance for AdÃ©le, cast
about for some place where he could place
her.</p>

<p>In a paper he saw an advertisement to this
effect:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Astrology.</span>&mdash;Madame Vesta Levine, the only real
fortune-teller in the city&mdash;electric baths&mdash;galvanism.
Boarders taken. W. 32d St."</p>

<p>The morning after his arrival he called upon
Mme. Levine, who was a middle-aged lady, with
an intellectual face.</p>

<p>She did not look like a charlatan, and exhibited
a diploma from a medical college, which
proved that she had some knowledge of the
healing art.</p>

<p>He was received in her office, which contained
only a few chairs, a table and some books on a
shelf, having no skulls, stuffed snakes and the
ordinary stock in trade of a fortune-teller.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, sir?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I have a sister," replied Bambino, "whose
mind is affected through a disappointment in
love and a subsequent shipwreck at sea. She is
young. I do not wish to put her in an asylum.
I have great faith in electricity and I will place
her in your care, paying three months' board in
advance, if you will receive her."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to take her as a patient," answered
Mme. Levine.</p>

<p>"You will try to cure her?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"I must warn you that she imagines she is a
departed spirit."</p>

<p>Mme. Levine smiled.</p>

<p>"That is nothing," she answered. "I have
had worse cases than that. When shall I expect
your sister, sir?"</p>

<p>Bambino promised to bring her round that
evening, and took his departure.</p>

<p>Later in the day he made his reappearance
with AdÃ©le, who evinced no attachment for him
and seemed only to care for being alone.</p>

<p>For hours she would talk to herself and occasionally
press her hands to her head, as if it hurt
her.</p>

<p>Mme. Vesta Levine had a room at the top of
her house prepared for her and detailed a colored
woman to wait upon her.</p>

<p>"Beware," said Bambino as he left the house,
"how you treat my sister. I shall demand a
strict account of you."</p>

<p>The madame smiled scornfully, for she glanced
from the swarthy Italian to the fair-haired
daughter of France, and she knew in one instant
that they were not related.</p>

<p>"Sir," she replied, "your 'sister' is perfectly
safe in my hands, and when you require her I
shall be perfectly ready to deliver her."</p>

<p>Bowing politely the Italian took his leave,
feeling that AdÃ©le was in good hands, and that
he could find her whenever he wanted her.</p>

<p>While returning to the hotel at which he was
staying, he beheld two gentlemen walking together
on Broadway.</p>

<p>No sooner had he seen them than he drew his
breath quickly and drawing his hat over his
brows, darted into a doorway to allow them to
pass, without perceiving him.</p>

<p>It was Jack Harkaway and his friend Harvey.</p>

<p>"We must hurry," exclaimed Jack, "or we
shall be late for Miss Van Hoosen's reception,
and you do not know how my heart longs to see
that girl once more."</p>

<p>Harvey laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he replied, "that you are
very much smitten in that quarter."</p>

<p>"I don't mind acknowledging it," said Jack.
"She is just about the sweetest, prettiest, most
charming young lady that I ever met in all my
travels."</p>

<p>"So she is," answered Harvey. "She is worthy
of you and you of her."</p>

<p>"If it had not been for the superlative attraction
that she has for me I should not be here
now."</p>

<p>"Well! You can congratulate yourself on one
thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"You have cut Lord Maltravers out of the
game entirely. He has no show now. Ha!
Ha!" laughed Harvey.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Jack. "You are right
there, but the fellow is dangerous."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Fancy his sending a fellow to assassinate
me. It was lucky I got the best of him."</p>

<p>"Between you and the fishes of the Atlantic
there cannot be much left of the villain," remarked
Harvey.</p>

<p>This conversation was distinctly audible to
Bambino, as the two young men had paused to
light their cigars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall see!" muttered the crafty Italian.
"Let those laugh who win."</p>

<p>At this moment an elderly gentleman, passing
by in the dim light of the evening, drew out his
pocket-handkerchief; and, in doing so, a large
wallet fell on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>He did not notice his loss.</p>

<p>Bambino, however, saw it, and a sudden idea
came into his head, upon which he did not hesitate
to act.</p>

<p>Starting rapidly forward, he picked up the
wallet, and pushing against Jack, dropped it
into the pocket of his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Here, you, sir!" exclaimed Jack. "Where
are you coming to?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," answered Bambino, in a gruff
voice.</p>

<p>"Don't do it again, that's all," rejoined Jack.
"There is lots of room for both of us."</p>

<p>Bambino retired as quickly as he came, and
walked after the elderly gentleman who had
lost the wallet.</p>

<p>"Sir," he exclaimed, touching him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>This man was a merchant connected with
the Produce Exchange, very wealthy, but very
mean.</p>

<p>"I've nothing for you," replied Mr. Cobb, for
that was his name.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Not to-night, my good fellow. I can't give
anything to tramps and beggars."</p>

<p>"Listen a moment," persisted Bambino.
"Have you lost anything?"</p>

<p>Instantly Mr. Cobb's hands dived into his
pockets, and a look of alarm stole over his face.</p>

<p>"Why, bless me, yes, my wallet!" he said.
"Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>"Did it contain anything valuable?"</p>

<p>"I should say it did. Valuable! What's the
man talking about? Where is it? Tell me at
once, or I'll call the police and have you arrested."</p>

<p>Bambino pointed to Harkaway, who was only
a few yards ahead.</p>

<p>"Do you see that person?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Which one&mdash;there are two together?"</p>

<p>"The stout one. It is he whom I saw take
your wallet from your pocket."</p>

<p>"Then he is a thief?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," replied Bambino. "Good-evening.
I hope you will recover your property."</p>

<p>Lifting his hat politely, he turned down a
side street, leaving Mr. Cobb to go after his
money.</p>

<p>Harkaway was perfectly unconscious of the
trick that had been played upon him.</p>

<p>As for Harvey, he was a little uneasy.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said, "did you notice the face
of that fellow who pushed up against you?"</p>

<p>"Not distinctly; why?" replied Jack.</p>

<p>"I did, and the features reminded me of that
Italian scoundrel of whom we were talking."</p>

<p>"Bambino?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The hired assassin of your sworn enemy,
Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>"Absurd!" exclaimed Jack. "The fellow
perished at sea. We know that very well."</p>

<p>"Never mind; the face haunts me."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't indulge such silly fancies,
Dick. I tell you the rascal is as dead as a doornail,"
replied Jack.</p>

<p>Just then, Mr. Cobb rushed up and seized
Harkaway rudely by the arm.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Jack. "What's the matter
with you? Has every one got a mania for
jostling me to-night?"</p>

<p>"My wallet, my wallet!" cried Mr. Cobb.</p>

<p>Jack shook off his grasp and drawing himself
up proudly looked him sternly in the face.</p>

<p>"My good sir," he said, "be kind enough to
explain yourself."</p>

<p>"You have stolen my wallet. I saw you do it."</p>

<p>This was a stretch of imagination on the part
of the produce merchant, but he relied on what
Bambino had told him.</p>

<p>"Do I look like a&mdash;a thief?" inquired Jack, not
knowing whether to get angry or not, and feeling
inclined to regard Mr. Cobb as a harmless
lunatic.</p>

<p>"No," admitted the merchant, "but gentlemanly
thieves are the most dangerous."</p>

<p>Jack turned inquiringly to Harvey.</p>

<p>"Dick," he exclaimed, "ought I not to knock
this man down?"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, you would be justified,"
replied Harvey. "But, my dear boy, he
is old and we should respect old age."</p>

<p>"True. Pass on, sir, and do not presume to
annoy me any more with your ridiculous
charges," said Jack.</p>

<p>"My money. I want my money, robber.
You shall not escape me thus," persisted Mr.
Cobb.</p>

<p>Again he laid his hand on Jack, who this time
flung him violently against the window of a
store.</p>

<p>A small crowd of idlers began to collect, and
the attention of one of the Broadway squad was
arrested.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" asked the officer, coming
up.</p>

<p>"Arrest this man," cried Mr. Cobb.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Robbery. I charge him with having stolen
my wallet, containing a large sum."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Richard Cobb, of the firm of Cobb and Co.
Every one knows me in South street."</p>

<p>The officer seized Jack by the elbow.</p>

<p>"I arrest you," he said. "Come along."</p>

<p>"Allow me to explain," exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>"You can do that at the station."</p>

<p>Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"This is a queer country," he replied; "yet
I make it a rule never to resist constituted
authority."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't find it much use if you did,"
answered the officer, swinging his locust club.</p>

<p>Harvey was much annoyed.</p>

<p>"Let me assure you, policeman," he said,
"that you have made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Can't help it," was the stolid reply.</p>

<p>"This is my friend, Mr. Harkaway, of England.
We are stopping at the Fifth avenue
Hotel."</p>

<p>"I guess the pair of you will stop somewheres
else to-night," answered the policeman, smiling
at his own joke.</p>

<p>It was useless to argue the point, and the
officer conducted his prisoners to the station,
where Mr. Cobb made his charge.</p>

<p>Jack indignantly denied the accusation, and
demanded to be searched.</p>

<p>Imagine his dismay, when the searchers produced
the missing wallet from the pocket of his
overcoat.</p>

<p>"That's mine!" cried Mr. Cobb, exultantly.
"What did I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Lock 'em both up," said the captain.</p>

<p>"I will send for the British Consul," exclaimed
Jack. "This is some infamous plot."</p>

<p>"Bambino," muttered Harvey.</p>

<p>"Right, Dick; your eyes were better than
mine. I ought to have known that the fellow
was never born to be drowned," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Put them in different cells," continued the
captain.</p>

<p>They were conducted below and locked up,
feeling very indignant, but unable to help themselves.</p>

<p>The charge looked very grave against them,
and Harvey was as much implicated as Jack,
because he was regarded as an accomplice.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb promised to appear in the morning,
and went home.</p>

<p>As he left the station he did not perceive a
man who was hiding in the shadow of a house.</p>

<p>This was Bambino, who had watched the arrest,
and finding that the game was securely
bagged, turned away with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Five years in State's prison for highway
robbery," he muttered, "will please his lordship."</p>

<p>Repairing to a telegraph office, he sent the
following dispatch by cable to Maltravers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Come over as soon as you can. The coast is
clear. The lady can be yours, as Jack will not be
likely to cross your path for some time to come.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bambino.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A LOVERS' QUARREL.</p>


<p>Professor Mole was very much surprised at
the failure of Jack and Harvey to return to the
hotel, and he was still more astonished, when at
midnight he received a note informing him of
their arrest on a false charge of robbery.</p>

<p>He at once proceeded to the station and had
an interview with them, and afterward procured
bail in the person of the proprietor of the
hotel.</p>

<p>The next thing was to see Mr. Cobb, who, now
that his money was recovered, was in a happier
frame of mind, and being satisfied of Harkaway's
respectability, consented to withdraw
the charge.</p>

<p>How the money got into Jack's pocket it was
not easy to explain, and the affair remained a
mystery.</p>

<p>It was unfortunately necessary for Harkaway
to appear in court, but on Mr. Cobb's application
he was discharged.</p>

<p>The case, however, was reported in the papers;
and Jack, to his mortification, read a
paragraph entitled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"SINGULAR CHARGE AGAINST AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jack Harkaway and Mr. Richard Harvey,
two English gentlemen of means and respectability,
residing at the Brevoort House, were charged at the
Jefferson Market police court with stealing a wallet
containing three thousand dollars in cash and securities,
from the person of Mr. Cobb, a well-known
member of the Produce Exchange. The money was
found on Mr. Harkaway, but Mr. Cobb, feeling assured
that there was a mistake somewhere, refused
to prosecute and withdrew the charge, whereupon
the prisoners were discharged."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was intensely annoying to Jack, because
it stabbed his reputation and cast a slur upon
his honor.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of explaining the
matter, and he felt that his character was
blackened, though his friends did not attach the
importance to the occurrence that he did.</p>

<p>The villain, Bambino, had not succeeded in
his purpose, which was to put Jack out of the
way in a prison, so as to make the coast clear
for his noble employer.</p>

<p>Yet he had inflicted a wound on a most sensitive
mind, and he chuckled inwardly at the
chagrin which he knew Harkaway must suffer.</p>

<p>With cat-like stealth he watched and waited
for an opportunity to deal him another blow.</p>

<p>The effect of the publication above referred to
was soon apparent.</p>

<p>Jack determined to show himself everywhere,
for he thought that to hide himself would be to
tacitly admit that he was guilty and felt
ashamed.</p>

<p>Consequently he drove out nearly every day.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole, Captain Cannon and Mr. Twinkle
were occupied in searching New York and its
vicinity for buffalo; but, much to their disappointment,
they could not find any.</p>

<p>The professor prepared an elaborate report
for the club which had sent out the expedition,
in which he stated: "After a prolonged investigation,
I am inclined to think that the buffalo,
like the mastodon and the dodo, is an extinct
animal, as I can discover no trace of a living
buffalo so far, though I am in hopes that when
we visit Long Island, which I am told is wild
and savage, we may meet with some specimen
of this almost mythical beast."</p>

<p>There was going to be a steeple-chase at Jerome
Park, and Jack sent Miss Van Hoosen an invitation
to ride to the grounds.</p>

<p>This led to the first severe mortification he received,
after the report in the papers, for Lena
refused in the following brief note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Miss Van Hoosen</span> presents her compliments to
Mr. Harkaway, and begs to thank him for his invitation,
which she is reluctantly compelled to decline."</p></blockquote>

<p>On receiving this, Jack showed it to Harvey.</p>

<p>"Look at that, Dick," he exclaimed, "and
tell me what is the meaning of it."</p>

<p>Harvey read it, and replied, "It is laconic
enough, and it means, simply, that the lady will
not go."</p>

<p>"What would you do, under the circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Call upon her and have an explanation."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised, if she has seen that
paragraph about Mr. Cobb's money."</p>

<p>"More than likely."</p>

<p>Jack bit his lips with vexation and his face
reddened.</p>

<p>Without losing any time he visited Lena, and
was shown into the reception-room.</p>

<p>Presently Lena entered, looking more than
usually sweet and charming.</p>

<p>There was some slight embarrassment in her
manner, as she held out her hand and requested
him to be seated.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry you cannot come with us," he
said.</p>

<p>"So am I," she replied. "But I am glad to
have an opportunity of explaining. There is no
gentleman of my acquaintance whom I esteem
more than I do you."</p>

<p>Jack bowed politely, and felt that he could
have laid down his life for her, for saying those
words.</p>

<p>"My brother," she continued, "has read
something about you in a journal, and he says I
ought not to receive your visits. I feel that
there must be some mistake. If you could only
see my brother and explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>A tall gentleman, a few years older than Jack,
entered the room at this moment.</p>

<p>"No explanation is necessary," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jack flushed indignantly.</p>

<p>"I presume," he said, "I have the honor of
addressing Mr. Alfred Van Hoosen?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," replied the new-comer,
stiffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the brother of this lady?"</p>

<p>"Precisely, sir."</p>

<p>"In that case, your relationship prevents me
from taking the notice of your words which I
otherwise should."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said Alfred Van Hoosen, as he
smiled sarcastically, "pray do not let that
stand in your way."</p>

<p>"I was simply desirous of assuring your sister
that there was absolutely no foundation for the
report to which she alluded."</p>

<p>"The case speaks for itself."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you do not consider
me a proper person to visit at your
house?"</p>

<p>"That is what I intended to convey to you,
and I have to thank you for saving me the
trouble of expressing myself."</p>

<p>Jack turned to Lena, regarding her almost
with an imploring glance.</p>

<p>"Do you concur in your brother's opinion?"
he asked.</p>

<p>She would not trust herself to speak, but inclined
her head.</p>

<p>Burning with mortification, Jack quitted the
house with despair in his heart, for it seemed as
if Lena was lost to him forever.</p>

<p>In order to regain her good-will it would be
necessary to satisfy her brother, and as he
would listen to no explanation, this course seemed
impossible.</p>

<p>For some time he was inconsolable, but he determined
to go to the race all the same, hoping
that he might at least see Lena there.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, and all the wealth and
fashion of New York was hastening toward the
Park.</p>

<p>On Eighth avenue they passed an open carriage,
in which were seated Miss Van Hoosen
and her mother.</p>

<p>In spite of his dismissal of the day before,
Jack ventured to raise his hat, but Lena did not
bow, though he fancied her eyes appeared to
seek his.</p>

<p>"Fine girl that," remarked a gentleman who
sat by Jack. "You appear to know her."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jack, "I met them in Paris&mdash;that
is&mdash;her mother and herself."</p>

<p>"Fine family. Best in New York. Regular
Knickerbocker stock. Are you acquainted with
her brother?"</p>

<p>"I have met him," said Jack a little confused.</p>

<p>"He rides to-day."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I was not aware of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, he mounts a horse called Warrior. The
knowing ones are betting two to one on him,
and I heard him say at the Union Club last
night, that if he won he would give the cup to
his sister."</p>

<p>Jack was not of an uncharitable disposition,
but some how or another he hoped that Alfred
Van Hoosen would not win.</p>

<p>At length the course was reached, and Jack
took a walk to the starting-place to have a look
at the horses.</p>

<p>He was an excellent cross-country rider himself,
and he loved a horse dearly.</p>

<p>All at once he saw a gentleman drive up to
one of the stables, and alight hurriedly from his
buggy. In doing which he slipped from the
step and fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>A cry of pain escaped him.</p>

<p>"Confound it," he exclaimed. "I've sprained
my ankle."</p>

<p>It was Alfred Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>Leaning on the arm of his trainer, who hurried
up to offer his support, he entered the stable.</p>

<p>Jack lingered around the spot to see what the
result of the accident would be, for it appeared
as if Mr. Van Hoosen would be unable to ride
his horse that day.</p>

<p>While he was waiting, Harvey met him and
said excitedly:</p>

<p>"I have been looking for you."</p>

<p>"Anything happened?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, but I want you to be upon your
guard."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Near the grand stand, I saw that Italian
ruffian Bambino, whom Lord Maltravers hired to
kill you."</p>

<p>Jack smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he replied, "it is evident
to me that you have got Bambino on the
brain."</p>

<p>"I can trust my eyes, I suppose," answered
Harvey, a little petulantly.</p>

<p>"Not in this case. You have seen a man who
resembles Bambino, that is all."</p>

<p>"And I distinctly assert it is the assassin himself."</p>

<p>"Bosh!"</p>

<p>"All right. A willful man must have his
way," said Harvey, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I should like to argue the point with you,
but you are such a confirmed skeptic, I fear I
should be wasting my time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am open to conviction," Harkaway
rejoined.</p>

<p>"Well, now, is it not possible that when the assassin
jumped overboard he might have gained
the abandoned vessel?"</p>

<p>"Possible, but not probable."</p>

<p>"Granting the fact of his having gained it,
could he not have been taken off and brought to
New York?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Jack, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>"What do you think now?"</p>

<p>"I begin to believe in your Bambino."</p>

<p>"Shake hands on that. I think I begin to see
how the money of Mr. Cobb came into your
pocket; it was an attempt to blast your reputation.
Having failed to kill you, he stabs your
character and wounds you in your tenderest and
most susceptible part. Here is another point&mdash;Lord
Maltravers, this scoundrel's master, is
your rival for the affections of Miss Van Hoosen."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly!"</p>

<p>"Well, you call and are refused the house,
simply on account of this alleged robbery.
What is more calculated to please Maltravers!"</p>

<p>"True. I am willing to admit, Dick, that you
are a genius, and I will be on my guard, as you
suggest," said Jack.</p>

<p>The course was crowded with people and carriages.
It was the most brilliant gathering of
the year, and still the people came.</p>

<p>A bell rung to give notice that the start for
the steeple-chase was about to be made.</p>

<p>There were a dozen entries; some of the horses
were ridden by their owners, some by professional
jockeys.</p>

<p>The horses and their riders began to show
themselves on the track, and some took preliminary
canters, exciting the admiration and criticism
of the spectators.</p>

<p>Presently, the trainer of Warrior came out of
the stable, looking very much disconcerted.</p>

<p>He approached two men who were standing
near Harkaway, and the conversation which ensued
was distinctly audible.</p>

<p>"Is the boss much hurt?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Yes, his foot has swelled so that I had to cut
his boot off. He's lying on a bale of hay, and in
great pain."</p>

<p>"Then he won't ride Warrior to-day?"</p>

<p>"He can't."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked
the man.</p>

<p>"He wants you to take the mount and will
pay you well. He knows you are a good rider."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to risk breaking my neck, by
riding a beast with such a temper as Warrior,"
replied the man.</p>

<p>"You're a fool."</p>

<p>"Maybe so, in your estimation, but I'm not
tired of my life yet. Why, I would not cross
that brute's back in a flat race, let alone a steeple-chase.
Mr. Van Hoosen is the only one who
can manage him, and perhaps he'd come to
grief at the first steep fence."</p>

<p>"Then we shall have to withdraw him," said
the trainer sadly.</p>

<p>"That's all you can do."</p>

<p>"It's a pity, for I thought he'd win <i>sure</i>, and
I have bet more money on him than I care to
lose."</p>

<p>Impelled by an irresistible motive, and filled
with a dare-devil spirit, which he could not
keep down at times, Harkaway touched the
trainer on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you want some one to ride your horse?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll do it."</p>

<p>The trainer eyed him curiously, and the result
of his inspection appeared to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>"How much do you want for it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. I am a gentleman, and will
do it just for the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," replied the trainer touching
his hat respectfully.</p>

<p>"Get the colors, bring them into the stable,
and I'll soon be in the saddle."</p>

<p>"Won't you come inside and see Mr. Van
Hoosen, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary. I&mdash;I don't care to disturb
him. Besides, there is no time to be lost.
There goes the bell to clear the course, again,
and most of the horses are in the paddock."</p>

<p>"Who shall I tell master is riding the horse,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Say Mr. Smith," replied Jack, who wished
to keep his identity concealed from Mr. Van
Hoosen.</p>

<p>The trainer led the way to the stables; the
jockey's dress was brought and put on; Warrior
was led out. He was a powerful horse,
well-bred and in every respect a magnificent animal.
He threw his ears back and kicked out
viciously as if to show his temper.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Jack?" asked
Harvey.</p>

<p>"Ride the beauty," was the reply.</p>

<p>"He's no lamb, if I'm any judge. Look at his
ugly eye."</p>

<p>Jack patted Warrior's neck, saying, "Soho!
my lad. Steady!" When he sprung into the
saddle, grasped the reins firmly and received
the whip from the trainer.</p>

<p>"Be careful how you use the spur, sir," exclaimed
the latter.</p>

<p>Jack nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>"Go and put your money on, Dick," he said.
"I mean to win this race or break the horse's
heart and my own neck, just to show a certain
young lady and her brother what I can do."</p>

<p>Touching Warrior lightly with his whip, he
cantered toward the inclosure, where the other
horses had already assembled.</p>

<p>The Van Hoosen colors were, black cap and
white shirt with large black bands. If not pretty,
it was at least very conspicuous and calculated
to attract attention.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RACE.</p>


<p>Going on the course, Jack gave Warrior a
canter to see what he was made of, and found
him a fast goer, well up to his weight, but inclined
to be restive and have his own way.</p>

<p>In front of the grand stand, which was
thronged with elegantly-dressed ladies and
gentlemen, Jack stopped short in the canter and
took a look at the sea of faces.</p>

<p>In the front row was Miss Van Hoosen and her
mother. They had evidently heard nothing
about Alfred's accident, for when they recognized
the horse and the colors, they appeared
much astonished.</p>

<p>Jack could not resist the temptation of bowing
to Lena, who, quite perplexed, acknowledged his
salutation by a slight inclination of the head.</p>

<p>Then he cantered gracefully back to the starting-place,
taking his position among the other
riders, to be ready for the start.</p>

<p>This was effected without much trouble, no
time being allowed Harkaway for reflection.</p>

<p>He did not consider that he had undertaken a
dangerous task in consenting to ride an animal
he knew nothing of, but he had confidence in
his own powers, and had never been much in
the habit of calculating on consequences.</p>

<p>"They're off! they're off!" shouted the crowd,
as the beautiful creatures dashed past, like so
many arrows from a bow.</p>

<p>Jack was perfectly satisfied that Warrior had
wind and bottom enough to stay, and he determined
to ride a waiting race, feeling sure that
several horses would tail off and that some
would fail at the jumps.</p>

<p>The first jump was made of hurdles, and this
Warrior took well, rising like a bird and going
over without any more trouble than eating a
measure of oats.</p>

<p>Although Jack held him well in hand his stride
told in the first mile, and he had cut down the
crowd considerably, there being only four horses
in front of him.</p>

<p>The most dangerous-looking one of these was
a long-barreled, long-legged black horse, with
powerful haunches and a way of going that
meant mischief.</p>

<p>At the second jump, which was made of
branches of trees to represent a hedge, Warrior
began to show his temper, for he flatly refused
to take it.</p>

<p>Jack put him at it again, and gave him the
spur, digging the rowels deep into his flanks,
while he lashed him with the whip.</p>

<p>With a snort of mingled rage and pain, the
horse rushed at the jump and cleared it; but he
was docile no longer, for he dashed away in a
manner which showed that he meant to have his
own way.</p>

<p>"Go it, my beauty!" muttered Jack, "we'll
soon see who is master."</p>

<p>Warrior was not at all backward in accepting
this challenge, and made the running in
fine style, taking leap after leap like a deer.</p>

<p>It required a strong hand and a quick eye to
manage him. Jack's arms felt as if they would
be pulled out of their sockets, but he kept his
seat in the saddle as if he had grown there.</p>

<p>The course was a circular one. Two-thirds of
the way round was an artificially-constructed
water-jump, a hole having been dug, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
twenty-five feet wide by forty feet long and
ten deep. Owing to recent rain this formidable
leap was full of water.</p>

<p>A large crowd had collected here, anticipating
some sport, for it was correctly surmised that
many horses would either refuse it or throw
their riders.</p>

<p>Jack had not been over the course, which was
a great disadvantage to him, yet he saw the
gleam of the water and prepared for it. The
black horse was leading, and behind it was a
strong Kentucky bay.</p>

<p>Both cleared the water-jump successfully.</p>

<p>Jack now passed the fourth horse, which had
weakened visibly. The third horse fell at the
water-jump, breaking his rider's collar-bone and
injuring itself so that it had to be shot.</p>

<p>This accident made Jack third in the race.</p>

<p>After the water-leap were three sets of hurdles;
and then, for about a mile and a half, it
was a straight run for home, over as nice a bit
of turf as a horse ever galloped on.</p>

<p>Warrior approached his task and Jack plied
him with whip and spur, fearful he might balk
at the sight of the water, as many horses will,
and determining to get him over if possible.</p>

<p>Loud cheers and cries of encouragement greeted
him.</p>

<p>The edge of the water was nearly reached;
he prepared to lift the horse; and with the breeze
almost blowing the words down his throat, he
stimulated the animal with his voice:</p>

<p>"Now, then, my darling," he said, "jump for
your life and mine."</p>

<p>Suddenly a man in the crowd opened an umbrella
and held it up near Warrior's eyes.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous, for the horse
swerved, refused the jump, and rearing up,
stood for a moment on his hind legs, pawing the
air.</p>

<p>Jack was afraid he would fall on and crush
him, but he was equal to the occasion, for he
threw himself off, just as Warrior fell back.</p>

<p>Before he did this, he caught sight of the man
with the umbrella.</p>

<p>"Bambino," he muttered.</p>

<p>The wretch had opened the umbrella, evidently
on purpose to frighten the horse and make
Jack endanger his life.</p>

<p>Harvey was right, after all.</p>

<p>The fall which Jack received was an ugly one;
for a moment he lay stunned and bleeding from
a cut on the forehead.</p>

<p>He had lost his cap, and his shirt was torn
and muddy.</p>

<p>Kind and sympathizing bystanders helped
him to his feet; willing hands caught his horse.</p>

<p>Harkaway looked about him in a dazed manner,
but his indomitable pluck carried him
through the trying ordeal.</p>

<p>His head was swimming and he was in pain,
but he never faltered for a moment.</p>

<p>Bambino had disappeared.</p>

<p>Perhaps he dreaded the vengeance of the
populace, for his cowardly trick could not fail
to be noticed by some one.</p>

<p>"Give it up, boss," asked a man who had
helped Jack to rise.</p>

<p>"No; I'll ride or die," was the answer.</p>

<p>He walked to the horse, mounted, and backing
his steed, who was quivering in every limb,
put him again at the jump.</p>

<p>The bystanders were delighted with his courage.</p>

<p>His phrase "ride or die" seemed to tickle the
crowd immensely.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" they cried. "Ride or die! Bravo!"</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked some one. "He wears
the Van Hoosen colors."</p>

<p>"It's Jack Harkaway," replied a stableman
who had seen Jack's drag.</p>

<p>"He's got grit in him."</p>

<p>"You just bet you he has."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the crowd, again. "Ride
or die! Sail in! Ride or die!"</p>

<p>This time, Warrior, as if ashamed of himself
for his former failure, made amends by taking
the leap, with the velocity of a meteor.</p>

<p>He landed safely on the other side amid the
applause of the spectators, and Jack gave him
his head.</p>

<p>Away they went, the horse seeming to like
nothing better.</p>

<p>The black horse was not so far ahead, as Jack
had expected, for he had not been husbanded
by his rider, and his strength was beginning to
fail him.</p>

<p>The first set of hurdles was cleared; at the
second, Warrior stumbled; but a vigorous hand
on the reins and a sharp reminder with the whip,
showed him his duty, and he went over.</p>

<p>At the third and last set, the second horse
fell heavily, throwing his rider.</p>

<p>Harkaway was now second in the race, the
leader being on the home stretch, and going in
a somewhat labored manner.</p>

<p>Going over the last fence, Jack put all his
horsemanship into requisition.</p>

<p>The grand stand was in view, and the hoarse
roar of thousands of voices became audible.</p>

<p>"Ride or die!" thought Jack, "and by Jove
I'll do it."</p>

<p>Whip and spur were not spared, and Warrior,
now mastered and tamed, overhauled the black
horse about half a mile from home.</p>

<p>Now ensued the most interesting and exciting
part of the race.</p>

<p>The Kentucky thoroughbred, ridden by its
owner, struggled gamely; and he and Warrior
went along neck and neck.</p>

<p>Louder and louder grew the roar of the assembled
multitude.</p>

<p>Jack knew he was drawing near the goal, but
a mist came over his eyes.</p>

<p>How near it was he could not tell.</p>

<p>The black horse at last seemed to fall back,
Warrior went on ahead. There was a shout of
acclamation.</p>

<p>"Black cap wins! Van Hoosen! Van Hoosen!"</p>

<p>Jack reined in his horse; the trainer seized the
bridle, and he dismounted at the stable-door;
though how he got there, he could not tell.</p>

<p>"All right now, sir. Step inside," said the
trainer.</p>

<p>The mist was deepening, and the dizziness in
Jack's head was increasing.</p>

<p>He could only see objects indistinctly.</p>

<p>What was the matter with him? Could he
have hurt himself more than he suspected?</p>

<p>Before him was a gentleman who sat on a bale
of hay, and he seemed to have a bandage on his
foot.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith," began the gentleman. "Why!
It's Jack Harkaway!&mdash;Mr. Harkaway, I mean,
pardon the familiarity. How the deuce did
you come to ride my horse, sir?"</p>

<p>"You're Alfred Van Hoosen?" said Jack, in a
faint voice.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I am."</p>

<p>"Did I win the race?"</p>

<p>"Did you win it? Why, man alive! It was
the finest race on record, they tell me. Every
one is perfectly wild about it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," interrupted Jack. "I know I
ought not to have ridden your horse, but I
wanted your sister to have the cup, and if you'll
accept my apology&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was now Van Hoosen's turn to interrupt
Jack.</p>

<p>"Apology! my dear fellow," he said. "I
don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"You didn't treat me well the other day, and
I know it was wrong to ride your horse."</p>

<p>"You have done me the greatest service one
man could do another," replied Van Hoosen.
"When I sprained my ankle, I hurt it badly,
and I am told I shall not get out of the house for
a month at least. At present I am suffering terrible
torture. If you had not ridden my horse,
I should have been a ruined man, for I don't
mind telling you I had backed my mount
heavily, and I stood to lose more than I can afford.
It would have broken my heart to go to
my mother and ask her to pay my debts of honor.
You have saved me."</p>

<p>Jack's face lighted up with a faint smile.</p>

<p>It was the brother of the girl he loved who
was talking to him.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully glad," he said. "It pleases me
to help a man out of a bad place. If your man
will give me my coat, I'll go home now, and
send you the colors in the morning. I've got
friends here&mdash;drove my drag down, you know,
and I fear I have neglected them."</p>

<p>"Sit down a moment," replied Van Hoosen.
"You're a fine fellow, Harkaway, and I'm sorry
for what I said yesterday."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, my dear fellow. I've forgotten
it."</p>

<p>"I've sent for some wine. Won't you wait?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes. Just a moment&mdash;the fact is&mdash;I'm
not well&mdash;I've got a sudden vertigo&mdash;I&mdash;I can't
see."</p>

<p>He extended his arms and groped his way, toward
the door; but ere he reached it he fell on
the floor, and the blood flowed again from the
wound on his forehead.</p>

<p>For a time his senses left him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A RECONCILIATION.</p>


<p>When Jack Harkaway came to himself he
was in a strange room, and he did not know
what to make of it.</p>

<p>The apartment was elegantly furnished; pictures
of value hung upon the walls, and it was
evident that he was in the house of people of
taste and wealth.</p>

<p>"Hello! where am I?" he asked.</p>

<p>The heavy damask curtains were drawn
around the windows, so that only a faint light
penetrated to the bedside.</p>

<p>Yet in the imperfect light Jack fancied he
saw a shadowy female form, exquisitely symmetrical,
get up from a lounge and leave the
room.</p>

<p>A bell-rope hung by the side of the bed, which
attracted Jack's attention, and he rung it violently.</p>

<p>Raising himself up, he sunk down again as if
unable to sustain his weight.</p>

<p>"I'm frightfully weak," he murmured.
"Wonder if I've been sick?"</p>

<p>Presently a footstep sounded on the stairs and
a man opening the door, entered the apartment.</p>

<p>Jack recognized Alfred Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," he exclaimed. "So you
have come to, at last?"</p>

<p>"Have I been very bad?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Only brain fever, that's all."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"When you threw yourself off Warrior&mdash;by
the way, I sold him for fifty thousand dollars,
yesterday. Thanks to you."</p>

<p>"To me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;you made his reputation. But
as I was going to say&mdash;you struck your head
against a stone, just before you made that
famous 'ride or die' speech."</p>

<p>"Is it famous?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should think so. It's been in all the
papers, and you'll be called 'Ride or die Jack,'
as long as you live in this country."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?" replied Jack, while a
smile of satisfaction stole over his countenance.</p>

<p>He was not vain, but he liked to be praised
when he deserved it, and he knew he had ridden
Warrior for all he was worth.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he added.</p>

<p>"In my house. I took the liberty of bringing
you here," replied Alfred Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"Don't apologize."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I must," said Alfred, laughing.
"You apologized for riding my horse to victory,
don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Have I been ill long?"</p>

<p>"About ten days&mdash;but don't excite yourself.
The doctor says you'll be out in a week, if you
keep quiet."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll be quiet. Who has been nursing
me?"</p>

<p>"I am not at liberty to tell you."</p>

<p>"Was it your sister? I thought I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ask her yourself," interrupted Alfred Van
Hoosen. "I must leave you now, as it is strictly
against orders to talk to you. The nurse will
bring up your beef tea in a few minutes; be good
to yourself."</p>

<p>"One moment. Did you get the cup?"</p>

<p>"The steeple-chase cup? Yes, indeed. It
adorns the family mahogany down-stairs, and
mother is really proud of it. Good-by."</p>

<p>Alfred quitted the room, and Jack sunk back
on the pillow in a doze, filled with pleasant reflections.</p>

<p>Soon the nurse, who had been engaged from a
neighboring hospital, came up-stairs and sat
down to watch the patient.</p>

<p>She was not in the best temper, for she had
been disturbed while at supper and was lamenting
the good things she had left below stairs.</p>

<p>"It's very odd," she murmured, "that a sick
man can't be left alone for an hour. This one
wouldn't die or jump out of the window. That
buttered toast and those sardines I quitted were
real elegant; my mouth waters at the thought
of them."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words escaped her lips than
there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come!" she said, testily.</p>

<p>The door opened and a dark-haired man of
swarthy complexion appeared.</p>

<p>"Please!" he exclaimed. "I've brought the
medicine, from the drug-store, and they told me
down-stairs to come up with it."</p>

<p>"You ain't the young fellow that came before,"
the nurse said, eying him critically.</p>

<p>"No, he's a friend of mine, and he asked me
to come."</p>

<p>"All right. What's the directions?"</p>

<p>"You're to give the gentleman the white mixture
right away, and at midnight, the red."</p>

<p>"Are those the doctor's orders?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd wait here, while I go and finish
my supper; the folks are at dinner and no one
will know."</p>

<p>The man's dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cospetto!" he muttered. "I'd like nothing
better."</p>

<p>"What's that you said?" asked the nurse.</p>

<p>"Nothing, ma'am. I'll be glad to stay."</p>

<p>"What countryman are you?"</p>

<p>"Italian."</p>

<p>"Thought you were a foreigner. Well! you
stay here and I'll give you ten cents when I
come back. If he wakes up, call me, by ringing
the bell."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>The nurse at once quitted the room, and the
Italian advanced to the bed, looking intently at
Harkaway.</p>

<p>"It is he," he said in a low tone. "I have
tracked him to his lair. Now for the medicine,
but how to give it him? He will know me.
Perhaps I had best wait for the nurse."</p>

<p>He handled the bottle, which was an ordinary
two-ounce vial, and regarded it affectionately.</p>

<p>"Let him once swallow <i>this</i>," he added, "and
he will never wake up more."</p>

<p>Harkaway moved restlessly in his sleep.</p>

<p>Had he an intimation that Bambino was near
him, preparing to carry out another iniquitous
scheme generated by his fertile brain?</p>

<p>In sober truth, to give the fellow his due, he
served his master well.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers had no cause to be dissatisfied
with him.</p>

<p>The daylight had faded away and there was
but a dim twilight existing, which made it difficult
to discern objects.</p>

<p>Everything looked shadowy and ghostly.</p>

<p>Bambino had seen Harkaway's insensible condition
when he was carried off the course and
he had tracked him to the Van Hoosens' house.</p>

<p>The white mixture in the vial was a subtle
poison, and he had gained an entrance to the
house by pretending that he was a clerk from
the drug store.</p>

<p>Touching Jack on the arm, he saw him awake.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, dreamily.</p>

<p>"Your medicine," replied Bambino.</p>

<p>"Give it me, and let me sleep. I am drowsy."</p>

<p>"It is to make you sleep," said the Italian,
with a grim smile.</p>

<p>He took up a glass and poured out the colorless
fluid, which in reality was a death draught.
Harkaway sat up and extended his hand for
it, and having received it, raised the glass to
his lips.</p>

<p>At this critical moment the door opened and
the doctor who was attending him made his
appearance.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he said. "No light? and what
have you got in your hand? I am the doctor,
don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"Medicine!" answered Jack, replying to the
first question.</p>

<p>"Eh? I don't understand," said the doctor,
with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>"Some stuff you sent me, I suppose."</p>

<p>Bambino bent over the bed.</p>

<p>"Drink," he whispered.</p>

<p>Jack was about to do so, but the doctor snatched
the glass out of his hands.</p>

<p>At the same time, he struck a match and lighted
the gas.</p>

<p>"Now, let us see," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Weak and sleepy as he was, this action on the
part of the doctor roused Jack, whose eyes settled
on the Italian.</p>

<p>"Bambino!" he cried, shuddering as if his
gaze had rested on a black snake.</p>

<p>The doctor had removed the cork of the bottle
and tasted its contents on the tip of his tongue.</p>

<p>"Strychnine!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Bambino, finding he was detected and his
scheme frustrated, gnashed his teeth with baffled
rage.</p>

<p>It was high time for him to endeavor to escape,
and he made his way toward the door.</p>

<p>"No you don't, my friend," exclaimed the
doctor, barring his exit.</p>

<p>Bambino, as we know, was a man of unlimited
resources.</p>

<p>He drew from his vest a long, polished dagger
which scattered a thousand flashes as he brandished
it in the gas-light.</p>

<p>"<i>Santa Maria</i>!" he cried. "Steel talks, signor."</p>

<p>The doctor was in no way disconcerted, for he
quickly produced a pistol.</p>

<p>"Yes, my good fellow," he rejoined, "and
here is an iron dog that can bark."</p>

<p>Bambino made a rush upon the doctor, who
fired, but his bullet missed its mark and he
received the point of the dagger in his arm.</p>

<p>The coat was cut open, the skin slightly ripped
and blood flowed, though no serious injury was
done.</p>

<p>This was a fortunate miss for the Italian, who
at once made his escape down the stairs, and into
the street, where in the darkness he easily
eluded pursuit.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, doctor?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Only got a scratch, a mere flesh wound. Do
you know the fellow?" was the reply.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I do; he is a hired assassin."</p>

<p>"This in the bottle is a deadly poison, you have
escaped by a miracle."</p>

<p>The pistol-shot had aroused the whole house,
and every one came rushing into the room.</p>

<p>In a hurried manner the doctor explained
what had happened, and having cleared the
room, gave Jack a composing draught.</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen was much chagrined that
such a dastardly crime should have been attempted
in his house, and notified the police.</p>

<p>No arrest was made, however, for every effort
to find the Italian was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and in ten days, Jack was
quite well, though still a little weak.</p>

<p>His friends came to see him every day, and he
determined to return to his hotel.</p>

<p>Having announced his intention to Alfred, he
thanked him very warmly for his kindness.
All traces of animosity had faded away, and he
was in reality a friend of the family.</p>

<p>Lena smiled upon him, and was sincerely rejoiced
at his recovery, which at first, with a
woman's nervous anxiety, she had despaired of.</p>

<p>As he was going away, Alfred drew him on
one side.</p>

<p>"You won't think me rude," he said. "But
I should like to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>"By all means," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"In the first place, who is this Italian and
why does he persecute you?"</p>

<p>"He attempted my life on board ship; I have
reason to think he put the wallet belonging to
Mr. Cobb in my pocket; he frightened the horse
and he endeavored to poison me."</p>

<p>"But why? It is incomprehensible to me."</p>

<p>Jack hesitated for a moment, and colored
slightly.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, since you urge me," he replied.
"Lord Maltravers and myself are rivals
for your sister's hand."</p>

<p>"Ah! I suspected as much."</p>

<p>"Bambino, the Italian, is the paid spy and assassin
of Maltravers."</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen appeared confused, and a
look of vexation crossed his face.</p>

<p>"I have heard of Lord Maltravers from my
mother," he said; "of course I was prejudiced
against you, at first, on account of that affair
of Mr. Cobb's; now that is all removed."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Jack. "I am glad to
hear you say so, because I want to stand well
with you."</p>

<p>"We Americans are quite as punctilious and
particular as you English," said Van Hoosen;
"and I can tell you that the best families think
as much of themselves as you aristocrats who
are descended from the Normans."</p>

<p>"Why should you not?"</p>

<p>"Well, we are friends. You have proved
yourself a man, Harkaway, and I shall always
esteem you."</p>

<p>"May I beg one favor?" exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>"Anything in my power, to grant, you can
command," was the warm reply.</p>

<p>"It is useless to disguise the fact that I love
your sister, and I have every reason to believe
that she is not indifferent to me. Will you use
your influence with her, on my behalf?"</p>

<p>The expression of vexation which Jack had
previously remarked deepened on Alfred's face.</p>

<p>"I will do so," he replied; "but I fear it will
not avail you."</p>

<p>"Will you explain the reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is as well to be candid with you: my
mother, whom both Lena and myself respect
beyond every one and everything else in the
world, has made up her mind that my sister
shall contract a distinguished alliance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that? I am a gentleman
and I have a moderate income."</p>

<p>"Don't think for a moment," Alfred hastened
to say, "that I intended to cast any reflection
upon you. My mother tried in Paris to make
Lena marry a French count, and now she has
set her heart on an English lord."</p>

<p>Jack felt a quivering at the heart.</p>

<p>"Noblemen are scarce in this democratic
country," he said.</p>

<p>"Admitted; but my mother has already selected
her future son-in-law."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell me who this fortunate
scion of the aristocracy is?" inquired Jack, in a
cold, hard voice.</p>

<p>"It is your enemy."</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers?"</p>

<p>"The same," replied Alfred Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>Jack flushed with indignation.</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir, from what I have already
told you," he exclaimed, "the man is a scoundrel."</p>

<p>"True; and we must band together to save
Lena. I am with you all the time. Yet the
danger is imminent. We have had a dispatch."</p>

<p>"From his lordship?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he is expected here to-day."</p>

<p>Jack looked blankly at Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"Maltravers to be here to-day?" he ejaculated.
"I fought a duel with him in France, and
I thought the sword-thrust I gave him, would
disable him for some time to come."</p>

<p>A servant entered the room in which they
were sitting.</p>

<p>"What is it, John?"</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers is down-stairs, sir, and
Mrs. Van Hoosen requests your presence."</p>

<p>The young men looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Say I am indisposed," exclaimed Alfred;
"desire my mother to make my excuses."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And John&mdash;where is my sister?"</p>

<p>"Miss Van Hoosen is out, sir," replied the servant.</p>

<p>Alfred put his arm in that of Jack and drew
him out of the room.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "I will walk with you to
your hotel. I want to talk to you on the way."</p>

<p>They passed down-stairs and out into the
street, Jack's only consolation for the news he
had just heard, being the knowledge that the
brother of the girl he loved was his friend.</p>

<p>As they walked along, Alfred said: "I did
not finish asking you all the questions I wanted
to. What brought you and your friends over
here?"</p>

<p>"Frankly," answered Jack, "I came to see
your sister. My friends came over to find buffaloes
in New York."</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen burst into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Buffaloes in New York!" he said. "You
surely are not serious."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am."</p>

<p>"Why, you might as well look for Indians on
Staten Island. Is it possible that educated Englishmen,
such as any friends of yours must be,
can be so ignorant?"</p>

<p>"The average Englishman," replied Jack,
"knows about as much of America, as he does
of Kamschatka."</p>

<p>"Who are these friends of yours?"</p>

<p>"You have seen them, when they called at
the house during the time I was sick. There is
Captain Cannon, Mr. Twinkle, Professor Mole
and Harvey, though the latter is not as foolish
as the rest."</p>

<p>Alfred reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"We will have some fun with them," he said.
"Of course you can post Harvey."</p>

<p>"How?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"An uncle of mine, who is at one and the
same time very rich and very eccentric, has a
farm in New Jersey, not very far from New
York, and his pet idea is to tame the buffalo and
make him subservient to husbandry."</p>

<p>"Has he any on his farm?"</p>

<p>"A score or more. Uncle is away in Philadelphia.
The farm is in charge of an old servant
of the family, with whom I can do what I
like."</p>

<p>"What's your plan?"</p>

<p>"I will invite your friends to a grand buffalo-hunt
in New Jersey."</p>

<p>"But your uncle!"</p>

<p>"Never mind him; I am his favorite nephew
and he has made his will in my favor."</p>

<p>"He may revoke it."</p>

<p>"Not he. The old boy loves a joke too well,"
replied Alfred. "Shall we do it?"</p>

<p>"Willingly."</p>

<p>"That is settled, then. I will make all my
arrangements to-day, and if you will be good
enough to invite your friends on my behalf, we
will start early to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Why delay? a little fun will relieve your
mind."</p>

<p>"But with regard to Maltravers?"</p>

<p>"Leave him to me. I am your friend. You
do not wholly understand the service you did
me in riding my horse to win. You saved me
from financial ruin, and made a friend of me
for life."</p>

<p>"Yet he will meet your sister. You will be
away and your mother's influence may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be easy, Harkaway. If I have any voice in
the matter, he shall never marry Lena!" exclaimed
Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I mean, if the court knows herself and
I think she does. Good-by. I will go home,
see how the thing works, and talk to Lena. To-morrow
you shall hear what she says."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>This speech of Alfred Van Hoosen's cheered
Jack up considerably. Since he had made
friends with Alfred and been an inmate of his
mother's house, his love for Lena had doubled
in intensity. He felt that he could not live
without her.</p>

<p>The presence of Lord Maltravers in New
York was a standing menace against the accomplishment
of his marriage with Lena. He had
a bitter, unscrupulous and unrelenting enemy
to deal with. It had already been shown that
he would stop at nothing.</p>

<p>With a heart full of conflicting emotions,
Jack went to his hotel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FORTUNE-TELLING.</p>


<p>When Alfred Van Hoosen quitted Harkaway
he dropped in at the Union Club and played a
couple of games of billiards.</p>

<p>He played very badly, for his thoughts were
intent on anything but the game.</p>

<p>"Beaten you again," said his friend; "what
is the matter with you this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"My right hand has lost its cunning."</p>

<p>"Play another?"</p>

<p>"Not to-day, you will have to excuse me," said
Alfred.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen entered the room and approached
Van Hoosen, one saying:</p>

<p>"Ah! Van, glad to see you. I want to make
you acquainted with my friend, Lord Maltravers.
Just arrived from England. He has brought
a letter of introduction to me and tells me that
he met your people in Paris."</p>

<p>Alfred shook hands with his friend, who was
named Sinclair, and was well known as a banker
in Wall street, while he bowed somewhat
stiffly to the peer.</p>

<p>The latter placed a glass in his eye, and stared
somewhat rudely at Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"Pleased to know you, you know," he exclaimed.
"But I thought you were out of form; your
mother sent up for you, but you were indisposed;
preferred playing billiards to seeing me, eh?"</p>

<p>"I can choose my own occupation, I guess,"
replied Alfred, who did not like his lordship's
manner.</p>

<p>The tone in which he was addressed was offensive.</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly; I can forgive anything to the
brother of such a charming sister."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to forgive me anything.
Lord Maltravers," said Alfred haughtily, "and
I beg, once for all, that you will not dare to take
the liberty of mentioning Miss Van Hoosen's
name in a billiard-room."</p>

<p>"But it's a club, you know."</p>

<p>"That makes no difference; don't do it."</p>

<p>"Eh?" said his lordship, calling the eye-glass
into requisition again.</p>

<p>"Don't <i>dare</i> to do it."</p>

<p>"Did you say dare?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I did. Is it necessary to repeat
it?" replied Alfred, turning away.</p>

<p>Maltravers stared after him, and taking up a
cue began to knock the balls about, remarking
as he did so: "Queer people, these Americans."</p>

<p>Sinclair ran after Alfred, and caught him at
the door.</p>

<p>"What's got into you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing," was the evasive answer.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you would insult a friend of
mine."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I have my reasons. The fellow
was not too conciliatory to me, and I'm not running
after English lords just now. Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>Alfred left the club, more than ever inclined
to support the cause of Jack Harkaway.</p>

<p>Dinner was ready, when he reached home, and
when the meal was over, he had an opportunity
of speaking to his sister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Hoosen had gone to the opera, having
accepted a seat in Lord Maltravers's box, but
Lena remained at home under the plea of a
severe headache.</p>

<p>The brother and sister sat on a lounge together,
and Alfred slipped his arm round her waist.</p>

<p>"You have stayed home, my baby," he said,
"because you didn't want to meet <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?" asked Lena.</p>

<p>"This English puppy, Lord Maltravers. Is it
not so, sis?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she replied. "When did you
see him?"</p>

<p>"To-day, at the club, and we came near having
a row."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"He mentioned your name, and I told him
that I did not care to have my sister spoken of
in a public place."</p>

<p>"That was right," said Lena.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my pet, which do you like best,
Maltravers or Harkaway?"</p>

<p>Lena blushed scarlet.</p>

<p>"I esteem Mr. Harkaway very much," she
replied.</p>

<p>"Esteem?" he repeated. "Is not that cold?"</p>

<p>"Well, as far as love goes, I do not know that
I love any one."</p>

<p>"Yet you have lots of admirers."</p>

<p>"Have I?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly you have, and a pretty girl
like you deserves them. But tell me, do you
care for this upstart lord?"</p>

<p>"Mamma says he has the blood of forty generations
in his veins, and is the representative of
one of the first noble families in England."</p>

<p>"I know mamma's weakness, and I am ashamed
of it; but let me put it to you plainly. If you
had your choice of the two men, which would
you rather marry?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?" replied Lena with an
arch smile.</p>

<p>"Harkaway."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to your opinion. I will
not contradict you. Yet, Alfred, I cannot offend
our mother, and I must be civil to a man,
I freely admit, I do not like."</p>

<p>"If you ever marry him, I'll never speak to
you again."</p>

<p>"That would be a terrible punishment," said
Lena, "for you know full well, how much I
think of you, Alfred."</p>

<p>"I do know it, sis, but my advice to you is to
consult your own happiness."</p>

<p>"I cannot be happy if I offend mamma."</p>

<p>"But you cannot be happy if you marry
Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>"That is the dilemma," said Lena, "and how
am I to get out of it?"</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen shook his head.</p>

<p>"Give me a few days to think the matter
over," he replied, "and perhaps I can see some
way out of the difficulty. One thing I know, I
would rather see you drop down dead at the
altar, than become the wife of that man."</p>

<p>"Oh! Alfred. What dreadful language!"</p>

<p>"You do not know so much about him as I
do. I am Harkaway's friend now, and I don't
want you to encourage Maltravers. You will
do that much for me?"</p>

<p>"I can make no promise."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I must obey mamma&mdash;oh!" she added, while
the tears flooded her eyes, "I wish I had never
been born!"</p>

<p>"That is a foolish wish."</p>

<p>"No. You have never known what it is to
struggle between inclination and duty," said
Lena.</p>

<p>"That will do. I am satisfied with that answer!"
cried Alfred Van Hoosen. "Be true to
yourself, sis, and trust to my inventive faculties
to make you happy."</p>

<p>He kissed his sister affectionately, and she
sought the privacy of her own chamber.</p>

<p>In a little while she grew tired of being alone,
and threw aside a book which she had endeavored
to read.</p>

<p>Ringing her bell, she summoned her maid
whom she had brought from Paris with her; this
was a bright little brunette named Fifine.</p>

<p>"Did ma'm'selle ring?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me what to do with myself. I am
<i>distraite</i>."</p>

<p>"Is it that ma'm'selle will go to the theater?"
asked Fifine. "But no, she can not go alone.
<i>Tiens</i>! Why not have your fortune told?"</p>

<p>"Where?" said Lena, struck with this novel
suggestion.</p>

<p>"There is one clairvoyant in this street, who
always tells true. She is called Vesta Levine."</p>

<p>"Have you been there?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, ma'm'selle, and she tell me I shall some
day marry a prince, with so much money he can
not spend it."</p>

<p>"That is encouraging," said Miss Van Hoosen
with a smile. "Give me my hat; we will go to
your fortune-teller, for I should like to know
whom I am likely to marry."</p>

<p>"In France," exclaimed Fifine, "women never
marry; it is the men who marry them. What
is the difference? marriage is a lottery."</p>

<p>Lena was quickly attired. With her face hidden
by a thick vail, and accompanied by her
maid she went to visit the clairvoyant who was
spoken of so highly.</p>

<p>She had no faith in the art of fortune-telling,
and believed astrology to be all nonsense, but in
every woman's breast there is a slight undercurrent
of superstition.</p>

<p>Consequently she fancied, in spite of her reason,
that there might be something in it.</p>

<p>The madame's house was not far from that in
which she resided, and five minutes walking
brought her to it.</p>

<p>Fifine rung the bell, and they were ushered by
the domestic, into a room dimly lighted.</p>

<p>Here they waited fully ten minutes, when a
curtain was thrown aside, the gas was turned up
as if by magic; and the madame, without speaking,
beckoned them into an inner room.</p>

<p>They obeyed the silent summons, the curtain
fell behind them, and an undefinable feeling of
dread came over Lena.</p>

<p>Madame Levine was a well-preserved woman
of forty, with a pale, delicate, classic face, and
large dreamy eyes. She was simply attired in
black silk and wore no jewelry.</p>

<p>The inner apartment in which they found
themselves was plainly furnished. Reclining on
a couch was a young girl who appeared to be
asleep.</p>

<p>This was AdÃ©le Bellefontaine, the poor insane
victim of Lord Maltravers's deceit, who had been
placed with the clairvoyant for care and protection.</p>

<p>Madame Levine was not long in discovering
that the girl possessed remarkable mediumistic
properties, and she soon tested her powers; the
result being so encouraging that she kept her in
a trance half the time.</p>

<p>"Be seated, ladies," said the clairvoyant. "If
you wish your fortune revealed, my fee is five
dollars. You will address your questions to the
medium who is on the lounge."</p>

<p>Lena Van Hoosen handed her the money, and
the madame sat down at a small harmonium,
from which she drew sweet and plaintive strains.</p>

<p>The music was not loud enough to drown the
sound of the voices, and Lena, in low, trembling
tones, said: "Shall I ever be married?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied AdÃ©le.</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"An Englishman."</p>

<p>She thought of Harkaway and Lord Maltravers,
who were both of that nationality.</p>

<p>To which of the two did the medium refer?</p>

<p>"Two men love you," continued AdÃ©le.</p>

<p>"I know it, but for heaven's sake which of
the two will be my fate?" cried Lena, who was
scarcely able to suppress her emotion.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le's fingers nervously clutched the gold
locket which hung round her neck.</p>

<p>"Come!" she said.</p>

<p>Lena Van Hoosen advanced like one in a
dream.</p>

<p>"Look," continued AdÃ©le.</p>

<p>Unclasping the locket she gazed upon the face
within.</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"It is he whom you will marry," replied the
medium.</p>

<p>Lena staggered back and fell heavily on the
floor.</p>

<p>The revelation was too much for her, and she
fainted away.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le continued to lie in a trance and was
apparently unconscious of all that was going on
around her.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">MRS. VAN HOOSEN SACRIFICES HER DAUGHTER
TO HER AMBITION.</p>


<p>When Lena Van Hoosen recovered her senses
she found herself in the outer room which she
had just entered. Her maid Fifine was engaged
in bathing her forehead with Florida water and
fanning her face.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"In the house of the clairvoyant, ma'm'selle,"
answered Fifine.</p>

<p>"Where is Madame Levine?"</p>

<p>"Gone. She took the medium away, and
they went out together."</p>

<p>"Oh! why did you bring me here?" said Lena,
wringing her hands piteously.</p>

<p>"Ma'm'selle wished to know whom she would
marry, and it seems to me that the English
suitor is rich and handsome."</p>

<p>"Be silent."</p>

<p>Fifine shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"For my part, I wish he would love me well
enough to marry me," she continued.</p>

<p>"You are impertinent. Let us go home," replied
her mistress.</p>

<p>Just as she had arranged her shawl and was
about to take her departure, Madame Levine entered
the apartment.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I am bewildered. I know not what to
think," answered Lena.</p>

<p>"Oh! as for that, you can always rely upon
the predictions of the medium, who is really remarkable."</p>

<p>"But she told me I should marry the man I
hate."</p>

<p>"Then it will be so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you explain how she came to have the
portrait of Lord Maltravers in her locket?"
asked Lena.</p>

<p>"That is a mysterious locket," said Mme. Levine;
"in ordinary times it is perfectly blank.
When the medium wishes to think of any particular
individual, the face is represented on the
glass."</p>

<p>Lena smiled, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that," she said.</p>

<p>The madame touched a small bell, and its silvery
cadence had scarcely died away when the
servant attached to the house entered.</p>

<p>"Bring down AdÃ©le," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The domestic bowed and departed.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Lena, under her breath. "Her
name is AdÃ©le."</p>

<p>Presently AdÃ©le Bellefontaine, pale and delicate,
entered the room, with an absent air.</p>

<p>She did not seem to notice any one.</p>

<p>"Child," exclaimed Madame Levine.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le started and pressed her hand to her
head as if in pain.</p>

<p>It was clear that the clairvoyant possessed a
strange influence over her.</p>

<p>"You called me," she replied.</p>

<p>"I did. Show that lady your locket."</p>

<p>AdÃ©le walked with a childish manner and offered
the locket to Lena, who, with trembling
fingers, opened it.</p>

<p>A cry of astonishment escaped her, for the
surface of the locket was perfectly plain.</p>

<p>"There is nothing there," she said.</p>

<p>"Is not that precisely what I told you?" replied
Mme. Levine.</p>

<p>Like one in a dream Lena put her hand on her
head, shuddered, and quitted the house.</p>

<p>"How beautiful she is!" she muttered, thinking
of AdÃ©le.</p>

<p>She was completely mystified, for it did not
occur to her that the madame, seeing the peculiar
effect the portrait in the locket had upon
her, had taken the precaution to remove it while
she was lying senseless in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>Lena reached home a short time before her
mother returned from the opera, and waited in
the drawing-room to receive her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Hoosen did not come back alone.</p>

<p>She was accompanied by Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>"You look <i>distraite</i>, my dear," said Mrs. Van
Hoosen. "I hope your head is better?"</p>

<p>"A little, mamma," replied Lena, flushing, as
she extended her hand to Maltravers, adding,
"How do you do? it is some time since we met."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. It seems an age to me."</p>

<p>"Did you like the opera, mamma?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say I did. It was Lohengrin. Wagner
may have his admirers, but for my part I
do not care for the music of the future."</p>

<p>Saying this, Mrs. Van Hoosen retired to take
off her bonnet and left the young people together.</p>

<p>Lena sat on the sofa, and toyed with a fan.</p>

<p>"I hope you do not consider my presence an
intrusion, Miss Van Hoosen," exclaimed Maltravers.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; any friend of my mother's is welcome
to me," she answered.</p>

<p>"Is not your reception a little cold?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of."</p>

<p>He left the chair in which he was sitting, and
ventured to take a seat by her side on the sofa.</p>

<p>Lena moved away, and pulled up the skirts of
her dress as if she were afraid of his touching
them.</p>

<p>"May I take this opportunity of telling you
how dear you are to me?" he said.</p>

<p>"I have heard that before, my lord," she replied.</p>

<p>"Lena&mdash;let me call you Lena&mdash;I love you
madly, passionately, and I offer you my hand,
my heart, my coronet and my fortune."</p>

<p>"I wish to remain single," she answered.</p>

<p>"It is your mother's wish that you should
marry me. We have had a conversation about
it."</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers," replied Lena, "I can
never love you. Would you take the hand,
where the heart can never be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. If I can only call you mine, I will
teach you to love me; believe me, dearest, love
will come in time."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you love another?"</p>

<p>Lena looked up indignantly, almost angrily.</p>

<p>"You have no right to pry into the secrets of
my heart," she replied.</p>

<p>"I know how it is," said Maltravers, bitterly,
"you love that fellow, Harkaway."</p>

<p>"Suppose I do care for Mr. Harkaway&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"You shall never be his."</p>

<p>"Allow me to ask you a question, my lord,"
she exclaimed. "Have you never loved before?"</p>

<p>"Never, until I saw you."</p>

<p>"Who is AdÃ©le?"</p>

<p>At this question he turned pale, and it was
only by the exercise of a great effort that he
mastered his emotion.</p>

<p>She saw him change color and gnaw his nether
lip and drew her own conclusions.</p>

<p>"I do not know any one of that name," he replied.
"What induces you to ask me?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Perhaps it was a silly fancy
of mine."</p>

<p>"Once more; will you be mine?" he urged.</p>

<p>"Give me time to think."</p>

<p>"I want your answer now."</p>

<p>"You shall have it in a week. I cannot talk
further, now," replied Lena. "Pardon me if I
leave you."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers took up his hat.</p>

<p>"I shall not intrude further upon you; in a
week I shall call for your answer. Please say
good-night to your mother for me," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Seizing her hand he raised it to his lips and
imprinted a passionate kiss upon it.</p>

<p>As he left the room he added, under his
breath: "She shall yet be mine, in spite of
every thing."</p>

<p>Scarcely had she drawn a sigh of relief at his
welcome absence than her mother entered.</p>

<p>There were tears in Lena's eyes, and she was
pale and tremulous.</p>

<p>"Where is Lord Maltravers?" asked Mrs. Van
Hoosen.</p>

<p>"He has gone."</p>

<p>"I hope, my child, you have not offended
him."</p>

<p>"No," said Lena, laconically.</p>

<p>"Did he talk to you on a delicate subject?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"That is right. I gave him permission to do
so. What answer did you give him when he
asked you to become his wife?"</p>

<p>"I told him he should have my answer in a
week, and I gave him to understand that I could
never love him."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, for I have set my heart
on your marrying that man. You must become
Lady Maltravers or I will disown you. Girls do
not know what's good for them."</p>

<p>"Pity me, mamma," cried Lena.</p>

<p>"I will not; pity would be wasted on so silly
a girl. Think of the brilliant match I have arranged
for you! There are very few young
ladies who would refuse Lord Maltravers with
his ancient lineage, fine form and splendid income."</p>

<p>"I do not love him."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! People do not marry for love nowadays.
Accept his lordship in a week or prepare
to leave my house forever."</p>

<p>"I will obey you, mamma," replied Lena.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Hoosen bent over and kissed her
affectionately.</p>

<p>"That is my own dear girl," she said. "I am
content now, and to-morrow I will arrange for
your wedding outfit."</p>

<p>That night Lena cried herself to sleep, for she
had allowed her mother to sacrifice her to her
ambition.</p>

<p>Jack Harkaway was lost to her forever and
she could never know what happiness was
again.</p>

<p>The week passed, Lord Maltravers called, and
was coldly but formally accepted by Lena.</p>

<p>It was settled that the marriage should take
place in a month, and the papers contained the
following announcement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Engaged.</span>&mdash;Lena Van Hoosen, daughter of the
late Cornelius Van Hoosen, to Lord Maltravers of
the peerage of Great Britain."</p></blockquote>

<p>This to all appearance sealed her fate.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"A BUFFALO-HUNT."</p>


<p>Alfred Van Hoosen kept his word in relation
to the buffalo-hunt, and early on a fine
morning the party took the cars for his uncle's
farm in Jersey.</p>

<p>Captain Cannon and Mr. Twinkle were in
high spirits, and even Mr. Mole looked forward
to some excellent sport.</p>

<p>Jack and Harvey pretended to be as enthusiastic
as the rest, while Van Hoosen discoursed
upon the danger attending such a hunt as the
one they were about to engage in.</p>

<p>When the old homestead was reached, Alfred
apologized for the absence of his uncle, who was
still away in Philadelphia, and did the honors of
the house himself.</p>

<p>Old Stock, the steward, who had been posted
by Alfred, spread an excellent lunch on the
table, and provided rifles and ammunition for
the party, but none of them, except Alfred,
Jack and Harvey, knew that the cartridges were
all blank.</p>

<p>It would never have done to kill the buffalo,
for Alfred's uncle would not have pardoned such
an outrage.</p>

<p>Champagne flowed briskly, and every one was
in high spirits.</p>

<p>"Are there many buffalo, sir, in Jersey?" inquired
Captain Cannon, of Alfred.</p>

<p>"Considerable," replied Alfred. "But not so
many as there were. They are gradually being
killed off."</p>

<p>"When in India," continued the captain, "I
shot a tiger before breakfast, regularly, every
day, for a year."</p>

<p>"Come, come! That is drawing the long
bow," said Mr. Twinkle. "I shot a lion once a
week, while in Africa, for six months, but a
tiger every day, is too much."</p>

<p>"Fact, I assure you, sir."</p>

<p>"I can quite believe it," said Professor Mole.
"For when I was in China I used to kill a score
of alligators, every day, just to keep my hand
in."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," exclaimed Alfred, "suppose
you show your skill on the buffalo."</p>

<p>They all jumped up, grasped their rifles, took
a supply of cartridges, and started for the park
in which the big game were grazing.</p>

<p>It was raining slightly, and Mr. Mole provided
himself with an umbrella, which did not add
to his sportsmanlike appearance.</p>

<p>The professor also carried a note-book, in
which to record any interesting fact concerning
the day's hunt, so that he could send a report to
the President of the Travelers' Club.</p>

<p>"Fine undulating country," he wrote. "Buffalo-grass
observable. Jersey the favorite
home of this remarkable animal."</p>

<p>After walking half an hour they came upon
an old bull who was standing under a tree.</p>

<p>"Ha! What have we here?" cried Captain
Cannon.</p>

<p>"That's a buffalo," replied Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"Dear me, I should have taken it for a cow.
How savage he looks!"</p>

<p>"Yes. The buffalo in his wild, untamed
state is very ferocious. Now, gentlemen, Harkaway,
Harvey and myself will stay here, while
you three go up and stalk the game. If he escapes
<i>you</i>, we will bring him down."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the captain. "Advance,
my friends. This is a glorious moment."</p>

<p>It was observable that Mr. Twinkle trembled
violently and could scarcely hold his gun.</p>

<p>The three advanced together slowly, but
neither would go ahead of the others.</p>

<p>Van Hoosen made a signal to Jack and Harvey,
who followed him into a thicket.</p>

<p>Here old Stock, the steward, was securely
hidden, awaiting their coming.</p>

<p>"What's in the wind now?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"We're bound to scare your friends, and I
want you to dress up as Indians. Stock has
everything ready for us, even to a pot of red
paint."</p>

<p>Jack struck an attitude.</p>

<p>"Heap big Injun, ugh!" he exclaimed, amid
much laughter.</p>

<p>They quickly proceeded to disguise themselves,
tied feathers in their hair, put on their
war-paint, and slung blankets over their shoulders.</p>

<p>While they were dressing the three buffalo-hunters
were approaching the old bull, who
watched them with as much curiosity as they
displayed with regard to him.</p>

<p>"Twinkle," said the captain, "you are entitled
to the first shot."</p>

<p>"N-no," replied Twinkle, with chattering
teeth. "Think you ought to have the honor."</p>

<p>"I decline it."</p>

<p>"Then by all means let Mr. Mole attack the
beast. How fierce he looks, and what terrible
horns he has! Go in, Mole, and slay him!"</p>

<p>"That is for you to do," replied Mole. "I
will lie down in the grass where he can't see
me."</p>

<p>"What is the use of that?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see? I can take a steady shot at
the savage creature and he won't know what hit
him."</p>

<p>The professor did not waste any more time in
words. He threw himself down in the long
grass, while Captain Cannon retired behind the
unfortunate Twinkle.</p>

<p>The latter had never in his life shot anything
bigger than a sparrow in spite of all his boasting,
and he was thoroughly alarmed.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed the captain. "Where
are Harkaway and the other fellows?"</p>

<p>"Not gone, are they?" inquired Twinkle.</p>

<p>"I can't see them anywhere."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"The cowards! They have run away and
left us to face the music! That's <i>mean</i>," said
Twinkle.</p>

<p>The bull at this moment left the shelter of the
tree and advanced toward the intruders on his
domain.</p>

<p>"He's a-coming!" gasped Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Fire!" said the captain.</p>

<p>Mr. Twinkle grasped his gun fiercely, shut his
eyes, turned his back to the buffalo, and
fired.</p>

<p>The blank cartridge struck Captain Cannon,
hurting him considerably in a very tender portion
of his body&mdash;not in front neither.</p>

<p>"Oh-h!!! I'm shot!" he said, clapping his
hands to the place and dropping his gun.</p>

<p>"Shot! did I hit you?" asked Mr. Twinkle, innocently.</p>

<p>"Did you? Why, you confounded idiot, I'm
covered with blood. Look here!" the captain
gasped, indignantly.</p>

<p>He withdrew his hands from the wound and
regarded the ruby fluid grimly.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry be hanged! What good will that do
me? Perhaps I shall die, or lose my leg; anyway,
I know I sha'n't be able to sit down in
comfort for a week."</p>

<p>"I apologize. It&mdash;it sha'n't occur again," replied
Twinkle. "I don't know how it happened.
This is a horrid old gun. I never shot with such
a funny gun before."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion you're afraid, sir," shouted
the captain. "Why don't you load up?"</p>

<p>"I distinctly refuse to do so, sir," retorted
Twinkle; "and after the injurious language you
have used to me, sir, I shall retire from this
shoot and leave you to kill the buffalo yourself."</p>

<p>Saying this, he ran away and hid himself behind
a neighboring tree.</p>

<p>The captain looked after him contemptuously.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bull was getting nearer, and it
was necessary to do something to check his progress.</p>

<p>Taking a steady aim, Captain Cannon discharged
his piece, and was surprised to see the
animal remain unharmed.</p>

<p>Loading up, he fired again and again, but the
beast did not fall, though he grew enraged, and
uttering a defiant snort, charged.</p>

<p>The captain ran with all his might and succeeded
in reaching a tree, behind which he sheltered
himself.</p>

<p>"Shoot him, Mole!" he cried. "You've a
capital chance; let the brute have it, under the
foreleg."</p>

<p>The professor fired, but with no better luck
than the others; and the bull, having his attention
diverted, took a survey of his new enemy.</p>

<p>Snorting again, he charged at the professor,
who sprung to his feet, threw away his gun,
and for want of a better weapon, opened his
umbrella.</p>

<p>Probably the buffalo had never before seen
this offshoot of civilization, for he was much
alarmed.</p>

<p>Turning tail, he fled ignominiously from the
field of battle, and was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>"Bravo," cried the captain.</p>

<p>"Victory!" shouted Mr. Twinkle.</p>

<p>They emerged from their shelter and warmly
congratulated the professor on his exploit.</p>

<p>"It was a happy thought," said Mole. "I will
make a note of it. 'The buffalo, though impervious
to bullets, will fly at the sight of an umbrella.'"</p>

<p>"I think we had better go home," exclaimed
Twinkle.</p>

<p>"And I second that motion," replied the captain;
"for my wound is becoming stiff and
painful. We have actually seen a buffalo and
had a terrific encounter with it. This will be
sufficient to report to our society."</p>

<p>"Quite," remarked Mole. "I am perfectly satisfied."</p>

<p>Suddenly they were startled by a fearful yell,
which made them jump.</p>

<p>Looking round, they beheld three red Indians
in all their majesty of paint, feathers and tomahawks.</p>

<p>"Oh!! look!!!!" exclaimed Twinkle, "we shall
all be robbed and murdered!"</p>

<p>"Indians!" said the captain. "Why did not
Mr. Van Hoosen warn us of this danger? I
thought the wretches were kept on their reservations
and guarded by government troops."</p>

<p>"They can't scalp me," remarked Mole.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I wear a wig, to which they are welcome, if
they will only spare my life."</p>

<p>"Whoop! la whoop!" yelled the Indians, dancing
about in eccentric circles.</p>

<p>Twinkle fell on his knees, and clasping his
hands begged for mercy.</p>

<p>"Oh! good, kind gentlemen!" he said. "Have
pity on a poor Englishman far away from home,
who only came out here in the interest of science."</p>

<p>"Ugh! take scalp, want heap scalp to put in
wigwam," replied an Indian.</p>

<p>"I've very little hair, sir; it is scarcely worth
taking."</p>

<p>"My white brother is a squaw, he has the
heart of a dog; the pale-face is a coward; ugh!
I have spoken."</p>

<p>Captain Cannon and Mr. Mole followed Twinkle's
example and sunk on their knees.</p>

<p>They looked very comical in this undignified
position.</p>

<p>The Indians stood over them, each selecting
his victim and threatening him with a tomahawk
in one hand and the scalping-knife in the other.</p>

<p>Jack knocked off the professor's hat and making
a rapid circle with his knife, lifted the wig.</p>

<p>"Ha! white man heap big fraud," he exclaimed
as he hung the wig at his belt.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir," replied Mole. "But I
couldn't help growing bald. It's my misfortune,
not my fault&mdash;nature did it&mdash;all my family lose
their hair quite early in life."</p>

<p>"Give watch, money!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, with the greatest pleasure in life,"
said Mole, emptying his pockets.</p>

<p>He handed out some currency, a watch and
chain, chewing tobacco and a small flask of
spirits.</p>

<p>"What this? fire-water, hey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, good, kind sir. It's old rye whisky."</p>

<p>"If bad, Indian kill lying pale-face," said
Jack, tasting the whisky and handing it to
Harvey and Van Hoosen, who evinced their satisfaction
by guttural sounds and grunts.</p>

<p>Harvey contented himself with cutting Mr.
Twinkle's hair as short as he could, and Van
Hoosen did the same for the fire-eating captain.</p>

<p>They then tore up their hats and the close-cropped
looked as if they had just come out of
jail, while Mole's polished crown shone in the sunshine
like a ball of ivory.</p>

<p>Mr. Twinkle and the captain had to give up
all their valuables, which they did gladly,
thinking they were very lucky to escape with
their lives.</p>

<p>"White men crawl on belly, like snake, and
kiss Indians' feet," exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>"I don't care about doing that," replied Mole.</p>

<p>Jack flourished his knife.</p>

<p>"White dog want to die?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! no. Not yet. I'll do it," cried Mole,
hastily.</p>

<p>Jack retreated several paces, and the professor
crawled toward him, kissing his feet.</p>

<p>Van Hoosen and Harvey made their captives
do the same thing.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" cried Jack, "we leave the white
squaws now."</p>

<p>He took another drink out of the flask, his
companions did the same, and then they vanished
in the thicket as mysteriously as they had come.</p>

<p>"That was a narrow escape," said the professor.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Captain Cannon. "I
shall have a fine story to tell when I get back to
London. First, I killed a savage buffalo bull, in
the wilds of New Jersey."</p>

<p>"You didn't kill him," observed Mr. Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Didn't I?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I think that honor belongs to
me."</p>

<p>"Any way, you shot something and that was
myself. I'll forgive you, if you will let me say,
without fear of contradiction, that I slew the
buffalo."</p>

<p>"You may as well tell a good lie while you
are about it," said Mr. Mole. "<i>I</i> always do."</p>

<p>"I have remarked that already," observed
the captain.</p>

<p>"A small falsehood is a contemptible thing,
but there is some glory in a big one."</p>

<p>"In what way can I amend mine?"</p>

<p>"Say that in the encounter with the bull he
tossed you on his horns, and you can show your
wound in corroboration of the story," replied
the professor.</p>

<p>The captain did not relish this allusion to his
wound, which was situated in an inglorious portion
of his anatomy.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole picked up the flask, which was
empty, and having discovered this fact, his disgust
found vent in words.</p>

<p>"These Indians are the meanest wretches I
ever met with," he said.</p>

<p>"What have they done now?" inquired Mr.
Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Emptied the flask&mdash;drained it <i>dry</i>, sir, by
Jove! I had intended to solace myself with a
quiet drink, but human aspirations are ever
destined to be dashed to the ground."</p>

<p>He sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Let us go back to the house and enjoy Mr.
Van Hoosen's hospitality," suggested Mr.
Twinkle.</p>

<p>"I believe that motion was seconded and carried,
a few moments ago," said the captain.</p>

<p>"It was," replied the professor.</p>

<p>"Then I will give the word of command. By
your right, march! And if I ever come out buffalo-hunting
in the Jersey wilds again, may the
Lord forgive me."</p>

<p>The three men marched disconsolately toward
the house, and arranged among themselves to
say that they had encountered a band of Indians,
who, after a severe fight, overpowered
them by the sheer force of numbers.</p>

<p>"Let me tell the story," exclaimed Mole,
"and you corroborate all I say."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the captain and Mr. Twinkle.</p>

<p>"I don't mind a little romancing," continued
Mole. "It comes naturally to me, and I know
it requires an effort on your part, gentlemen."</p>

<p>The sportsmen smiled and quickened their
pace, as they were anxious to reach the homestead,
and enjoy the good things which they
felt sure Mr. Van Hoosen would regale them
with.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the house, they were
met at the door by Alfred, Jack and Harvey.</p>

<p>"What sport did you meet with, sir?" asked
Harkaway.</p>

<p>"Splendid, my dear boy," replied Mr. Mole.
"You missed it."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"We killed the buffalo bull&mdash;at least, he was
hit and went away into a thicket to die. If it
had not been for a tribe of Indians who attacked
us, we should have had a capital day's gunning."</p>

<p>"Did the Indians fight you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Mr. Mole. "We were
absolutely surrounded by fifty of the red fiends,
but we showed a determined front and beat
them off."</p>

<p>"Did you kill any?"</p>

<p>"Did we. Well, I should smile if we did not,"
answered Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"Where are the dead?"</p>

<p>"Ask their comrades. When they saw they
were defeated, they retired in disorder, but they
carried their dead with them."</p>

<p>"Carried off the dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I will give them the credit for that."</p>

<p>"But how did it occur that your wig is gone
and these gentlemen have had their hair cut short?"
inquired Harkaway.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole looked a little confused.</p>

<p>"Oh! I will explain that," he said; "on our
way home we were attacked by a horde of
tramps."</p>

<p>"A horde?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about a score, and being exhausted by
our encounter with the Indians we surrendered
at discretion."</p>

<p>"That was rough on you, sir. It was indeed.
Did the tramps rob you of anything?"</p>

<p>"All we possessed; but we beat the Indians,
and if we had been possessed of any cartridges
we should have driven off the tramps."</p>

<p>"That is a very good story," said Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole looked indignant.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that insinuation?" he
exclaimed. "Do you doubt my honor?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no. Not for a moment."</p>

<p>"Then why is it a good story?"</p>

<p>"Simply because it is the best lie, Mr. Mole,
that I have heard for a long time."</p>

<p>Captain Cannon struck his breast with his
hand and Mr. Twinkle looked unutterable things
at Jack.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am concerned in this allegation," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"Did I allegate anything?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I deny the allegation and despise
the allegator."</p>

<p>"That's a stale joke," replied Jack. "But
look here, gentlemen, if the Indians cut your
hair or took Mr. Mole's wig, we can return the
hirsute appendages. If the tramps robbed you
of money or valuables we can give them back."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," continued Harkaway; "what do
you say to this?"</p>

<p>"And this?" cried Harvey.</p>

<p>"And this?" added Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>They severally displayed the spoils they had
taken, placing them on a table.</p>

<p>The consternation and dismay of the three
pretenders was funny in the extreme.</p>

<p>"Then you were the Indians!" said the professor;
grasping the tail end of the joke feebly.</p>

<p>"We were," answered Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! we dressed up, being determined to
have some fun with you, and as there was no
harm done, I hope you will forgive the joke."</p>

<p>"I do," replied the professor; "and I may
add that I knew it was you, Jack, all along."</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"If I hadn't known it, do you think I would
have allowed you to take my wig."</p>

<p>"Allowed me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was the only one I had, and a bald-headed
old man is not a cheerful spectacle, nor
calculated to inspire respect."</p>

<p>He took up his wig and fitted it on, after
which he appropriated the various articles which
had been taken from him.</p>

<p>"Ah! Jack, you think you are a very smart
fellow, but I have known you from a boy, and
you can't fool me," said Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"But I did to-day, though," replied Harkaway.</p>

<p>Captain Cannon took what belonged to him,
and appeared very indignant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harkaway," he said, "you and I are
members of the same club."</p>

<p>"We are."</p>

<p>"And we came over here to hunt the buffalo
in its native wilds and make a report at
home."</p>

<p>"You did, but I had other things to attend
to."</p>

<p>"Never mind, you have grossly deceived me,
and I consider your joke an insult, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Jack, coldly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do. Look at my hair! it will take
a month to grow. I shall leave this country at
once."</p>

<p>"If you do, the country won't miss you. I
don't think there will be a general mourning, or
that the nation will go into bankruptcy."</p>

<p>Mr. Twinkle put on his hat with a savage air.</p>

<p>"I shall go, too," he said.</p>

<p>"By all means. Go to&mdash;Hong Kong or Halifax,
if you like."</p>

<p>Captain Cannon put his arm in that of Mr.
Twinkle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Hoosen," exclaimed Mr. Twinkle,
"we are disappointed in you."</p>

<p>"Sorry for that. I generally pan out pretty
good," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"We are going, sir."</p>

<p>"So I heard you say before."</p>

<p>"We will not stay to partake of your hospitality, sir."</p>

<p>"Nobody asked you. I gave you a shot at
my uncle's old tame buffalo bull, but you had
only blank cartridges, and having done that, I
have no inclination to do anything further for
you."</p>

<p>"Blank cartridges!" ejaculated the captain.</p>

<p>"The deuce," said Mr. Twinkle. "That was
lucky for you, Cannon, when I fired round the
corner; I might have settled you, altogether."</p>

<p>"Come!" replied the captain, grandly.</p>

<p>"One word before you go, gentlemen," exclaimed
Alfred Van Hoosen. "You, as educated
men, ought not to have been such idiots as
to suppose you would find buffaloes and Indians
in New York State or Jersey, and you can't
blame me, as a playful American, for having a
joke with you, especially as your better-informed
friend, Mr. Harkaway, assisted me."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say," replied Captain Cannon.</p>

<p>"Nor I," replied Mr. Twinkle. "For my part,
I don't like the country, and the people are&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen stared at him, fixedly.</p>

<p>"Are what?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Twinkle made just the least little nervous
start.</p>

<p>"Oh! perfect gentlemen, of course," he added.</p>

<p>"Come!" again said the captain. "The gentlemen
shall hear from us."</p>

<p>"By cable, I guess," laughed Alfred.</p>

<p>"Do you join us, Mr. Mole?" asked the captain,
not noticing the remark of Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no," answered the professor. "I knew
it was a lark all through, and as I never bite off
my nose to spite my face, I will forgive Jack
this time, and stay to lunch with my very good
friend, Mr. Van Hoosen."</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>"No animosity, Al?" he added.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest in the world, my dear fellow,"
replied Van Hoosen.</p>

<p>Captain Cannon and Mr. Twinkle walked out
of the room together, fully determined to return
to England by the next steamer.</p>

<p>As they went, Alfred sung, the others joining
in the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We'll settle on the banks<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of the lovely Ohio,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through the wild woods we'll wend<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As we hunt the buffalo"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the refrain rung in their ears all the way
to the depot:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"As we hunt the buff-a-lo."<br /></span>

<p>Lord Maltravers was naturally very much
elated at his success in winning Lena Van Hoosen's
consent to marry him.</p>

<p>He was really very much in love with the
young lady, and intended to settle down and
live a quiet life with her.</p>

<p>That he had got rid of AdÃ©le Bellefontaine
forever, he did not doubt for a moment.</p>

<p>Everything progressed favorably with him,
as his plans gradually approached their fruition.</p>

<p>A few days before that appointed for the
marriage, Bambino entered his master's private
room, while he was at breakfast.</p>

<p>He sat down with an air of easy familiarity,
which was very unusual with him.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Maltravers,
looking up from his paper.</p>

<p>"My discharge," replied Bambino.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers put a glass in his eye and regarded
him curiously.</p>

<p>"Your what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My discharge. Is it necessary for me to repeat
it?"</p>

<p>"But, my good fellow, you are my life-long
star. I may need you in the future."</p>

<p>"I care not. Let me go."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. If you persist in your determination
to leave me, I shall go at once to the
Italian Consul, and let him know that Bambino,
the escaped murderer, is in New York."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"There is a price on your head."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You will be sent back to Italy, and pass the
remainder of your natural life at the galleys."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true," said Bambino, calmly.</p>

<p>"Reflect, my friend," continued Maltravers.
"However fond you may be of hard work and
black bread, however much you may be enamored
of the whip of the taskmaster, and notwithstanding
the charm a hot sun may have for
you, I will venture to say, that my service is
more agreeable."</p>

<p>"I wish to quit your service, sigÃ±or."</p>

<p>"And I say again, I will not permit you to do
so. It is not always that one can pick up such
an accomplished villain as you are."</p>

<p>"Do I suit you so well?"</p>

<p>"So well, that I will not part with you."</p>

<p>"I am a finished villain?" Bambino asked, in
a strange voice.</p>

<p>"Perfect in every respect."</p>

<p>"You have no fault to find with me?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>Bambino smiled quietly, as if pleased with an
original idea which had just occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Give me fifty thousand dollars," he exclaimed,
"and I will not trouble you any more."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers started from his chair, and
seized a cane.</p>

<p>"Dog," he said, "am I to stand this impertinence?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You say 'yes!' do you know of what you
are talking?"</p>

<p>Bambino rose and displayed his dagger.</p>

<p>"Cospetto!" he cried. "Touch me not. If
you so much as lay your little finger on me, I
will stab you to the heart."</p>

<p>Maltravers dropped the cane.</p>

<p>"Oh! decidedly," he said, "I shall have to go
to the Italian Consul."</p>

<p>"No, my lord," replied Bambino. "It is I,
who will have to go to the British Consul."</p>

<p>Maltravers turned pale with rage.</p>

<p>"Do you threaten <i>me</i>, you low scoundrel?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"What can you say, except that I hired you
to commit a crime&mdash;that is, I employed you to
kill Jack Harkaway?"</p>

<p>"I shall not go upon that."</p>

<p>"If you did no one would believe you."</p>

<p>"Possibly not," said Bambino, calmly. "But,
my lord, suppose I said that you <i>had a wife
alive</i>."</p>

<p>Again Maltravers changed color perceptibly.</p>

<p>"If you did you would lie," he replied.</p>

<p>"Oh! no. I am perfectly conversant with
your little marriage in France."</p>

<p>"Yes. I have talked to you about it, possibly,
in my confidential moments."</p>

<p>"More than that&mdash;I know where your wife is
at this moment, and I can produce her at the
altar when you attempt to marry Miss Van
Hoosen."</p>

<p>"You villain!"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Bambino, "you do me honor.
I feel proud to be so complimented by you."</p>

<p>He bowed low as he spoke, with mock
humility.</p>

<p>"Prove what you allege," cried Maltravers,
who was intensely excited.</p>

<p>"That's easy enough."</p>

<p>"Begin!"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary for me to show you my
cards," returned Bambino. "I can do what
I say, and I will do so, unless you buy me
off."</p>

<p>"I refuse to do anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"You defy me?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Harkaway may be more generous."</p>

<p>"Do you threaten me with an appeal to my
rival?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," answered Bambino.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers was beside himself with rage
at this insolent defiance, but he controlled himself
by the exercise of a violent effort.</p>

<p>"Let us understand one another," he said.</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>"You allege that you know of the existence
of a lady who claims to be my wife, and you
further say, that she is in New York and you
can produce her at a moment's notice, so as to
stop my marriage with Miss Van Hoosen?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And as the price of your silence you require
$50,000?"</p>

<p>"That is the sum."</p>

<p>"Where is this girl?" continued his lordship.</p>

<p>"I decline to say."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"That you know as well as I do. Will you
give me the money?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Bambino shrugged his shoulders, as he advanced
to the door.</p>

<p>"Then, all I have to do is to declare war to
the knife," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes. You cowardly ruffians always use the
knife. I prefer the pistol," replied his lordship.</p>

<p>He went rapidly to an escritoire and drew out
an ivory-handled pistol.</p>

<p>"This is my answer to you," he cried.</p>

<p>Bambino shrunk back, but he was unable
to avoid the ball which his lordship fired at
him.</p>

<p>There was an explosion, a puff of smoke and
the crafty Italian fell on the floor, the blood
welling from a wound in his head.</p>

<p>Hastily Lord Maltravers placed the pistol in
the death-like clutch of his victim.</p>

<p>Then he rung the bell violently.</p>

<p>This tragedy occurred at one of the leading
hotels and could not be hushed up.</p>

<p>When the waiter answered the bell, his lordship
was perfectly calm.</p>

<p>"This man, my servant," he exclaimed, "has
been despondent lately, and because I would
not allow him to return to Italy, he has committed
suicide. Summon the proprietor of the
hotel!"</p>

<p>The servant hastened to do so.</p>

<p>When the proprietor arrived, he was told the
same story, which he saw no reason to disbelieve,
and, an ambulance being sent for, Bambino
was taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>No report was made to the police, and for a
wonder no reporter got hold of the circumstance.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers followed his servant to the
hospital, and appeared much concerned about
his condition.</p>

<p>After the house surgeon had made an examination
he was prepared with his report.</p>

<p>"Is it serious?" inquired Maltravers.</p>

<p>"Very," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Will he live?"</p>

<p>"No. The man will die."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers could scarcely contain his
exultation at this announcement.</p>

<p>"Allow me to ask one more question," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," answered the house surgeon.</p>

<p>"Will the poor fellow recover consciousness
before he expires?"</p>

<p>"Possibly he will. I cannot say positively."</p>

<p>"When do you expect death to ensue?"</p>

<p>"Inside of forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers went away, slightly disturbed
in his mind. If Bambino recovered consciousness
for only a brief period, he might talk.
There was danger in that.</p>

<p>If he denounced Lord Maltravers as his murderer,
and if he pointed out the place where
AdÃ©le Bellefontaine was living, his lordship's
newly-found happiness would topple over like a
pack of cards built into a house by the hand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
a child, whose breath subsequently destroys the frail
edifice.</p>

<p>Eagerly he longed for the time to pass. Three
times that day he called at the hospital. His last
visit was at twelve o'clock. Bambino had not yet
spoken.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MR. MOLE PLAYS BASE-BALL.</p>


<p>Captain Cannon and Mr. Twinkle went back to
England after the famous buffalo-hunt, feeling themselves
insulted by the trick which had been played
upon them.</p>

<p>Jack, Harvey and Professor Mole remained at the
hotel.</p>

<p>It may readily be imagined that Jack was in no
enviable frame of mind.</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen was his friend and wished him
to marry his sister, but Lena had promised to
espouse Lord Maltravers, and so great was the
mother's influence that the day was already fixed.</p>

<p>Jack expected every day that Alfred would come
to him and propose some plan by means of which the
celebration of the marriage could be prevented.</p>

<p>He waited in vain and fumed and fretted until he
grew ill and pale.</p>

<p>Little did he know that at the same time Lord
Maltravers was as uneasy as he was himself.</p>

<p>He knew nothing about the dangerous condition
of the villain Bambino, and that Maltravers was
standing, as it were, on a volcano which might at
any time erupt and scatter all his fond ideas to the
winds, dash his happiness to atoms and shatter the
idol which he had set up for himself to worship.</p>

<p>If Bambino recovered sufficiently to speak, then
all hope of a union with Lena Van Hoosen was at an
end.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this condition, Mr. Mole
made the acquaintance of a young man who was
living with his parents in the hotel.</p>

<p>It happened in this way.</p>

<p>The Continental Hotel, on Broadway, was the
caravansera which Harkaway and the members of
the Travelers' Club stayed at, and the genial proprietor,
Mr. Merrifield, was much interested in the
eccentric professor.</p>

<p>Meeting him in the hall one morning, seated in a
chair with his legs on another, Mr. Merrifield said:</p>

<p>"I thought it was not an English custom, professor,
to put your legs up at an angle of forty-five degrees?</p>

<p>"My dear sir," replied Mole, "there is nothing in
this country that an Englishman cannot do and has
not done in his own land."</p>

<p>"Can you drink whisky straight?"</p>

<p>"Try me," said Mole, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Can you play base-ball?"</p>

<p>"I think so. The fact is, I am a good cricket
player, and I see no reason why I should not play
the emasculated game you call base-ball."</p>

<p>"Well now," said Merrifield, "I'll give you an opportunity
of showing what you can do in that direction."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"A young gentleman living in the house with his
parents, whose name is Morris Hart, is captain of
the Blue Stockings, and that club is going to play
the Red Stockings a match to-day."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The Blues are short of one out of their nine.
You shall take the place of the missing man, if you
like."</p>

<p>"I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Mind," said Mr. Merrifield, "you have said you
are a good base-ball player."</p>

<p>"Did I say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you lose the match through your bad
play, we shall blame you."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Of course," Mr. Merrifield continued, "I am not
reflecting on your veracity. I know very well that
an Englishman never blows. It is only an American
that brags about his country and says he can whip
all creation."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the professor. "I don't mind repeating
that I must be a good base-ball player, because
it is a mild edition of what we call 'Rounders,'
a game which small boys play and which cannot be
spoken of in the same breath with cricket."</p>

<p>"But base-ball is a dangerous game to play."</p>

<p>"Oh! pshaw!"</p>

<p>"People often get arms and legs broken."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. You should see our swift round hand
bowling. That would open your eyes a little."</p>

<p>As the professor spoke a young man approached;
he was tall, well formed and handsome.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Merrifield. "You are the very
man I was looking for. Professor Mole, allow me to
introduce my friend, Mr. Morris Hart."</p>

<p>They bowed and shook hands.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, sir," said Morris.</p>

<p>"I am proud and happy to reciprocate that sentiment,
my young friend," replied Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"Morris," exclaimed Mr. Merrifield, "you are
short of a man in your match with the 'Reds' to-day,
I believe?"</p>

<p>"We are, and I cannot find a substitute anywhere.
Guess we shall have to play eight against
nine."</p>

<p>"No indeed. The professor volunteers to fill the
vacant place."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" replied Morris Hart. "I am real
pleased to hear it, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to disparage the professor's accomplishments.
Yet I have always heard that the English
did not understand our national game."</p>

<p>Mr. Mole smiled disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Child's play," he said.</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"Base-ball."</p>

<p>Morris Hart bridled up at this.</p>

<p>"You won't find it so," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Not much," said Mr. Merrifield. "You bet your
high monkey munk."</p>

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed Mr. Mole, "the proof of
the pudding is in the eating. I will call base-ball a
very scientific game, and with your kind permission,
I will show you how an old cricketer can play."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Morris Hart.</p>

<p>This being settled, Mr. Merrifield left them together,
and it was arranged that Mr. Mole should go over
to the grounds at Hoboken at a certain hour.</p>

<p>Morris gave him the club clothes, blue stockings,
etc., which he put in a grip sack and left him, after
exacting a promise that he would be on time.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole was no sooner possessed of the cap, shirt,
drawers and stockings, than he went to his room and
put them on.</p>

<p>Very comical indeed was his appearance, for his
long, gaunt, angular form made him look like an animated
scarecrow.</p>

<p>Anxious to display himself, he went to Harkaway's
room, finding Jack and Harvey engaged in
conversation.</p>

<p>"Say, boys," exclaimed the professor, "what do
you think of me?"</p>

<p>They regarded him with astonishment.</p>

<p>"What lunacy is this?" inquired Jack.</p>

<p>"Eh!" exclaimed Harvey, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"I give it up," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Give it up?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Ask me an easier one."</p>

<p>"It must have escaped from a menagerie," said
Harvey.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole regarded them with a lofty air.</p>

<p>"No doubt you think yourselves mighty funny,"
he remarked. "But you can run me, all you like. I
am going to show these Yankees how an Englishman
can play base-ball."</p>

<p>"You going to play?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys. I am a Blue shirt, or a cap, or a
stocking, I forget which, but I know I'm blue."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will be black and blue before you
get through," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Good for the major," ejaculated Harvey, laughing.</p>

<p>"All right, boys. Have your little jokes with the
old man, but you will see how I shall paralyze the
Americans with my play."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," answered Harkaway, "and
would go with you, only I expect Van Hoosen here."</p>

<p>"Is there any fresh news about the marriage?"
asked Mole.</p>

<p>"None. Mrs. Van Hoosen has made up her mind
that Lena shall marry Maltravers," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Misguided girl!"</p>

<p>"She is, indeed. I have every reason to know that
she does not love him, and only a mistaken sense of
duty to her mother makes her accept him."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"What can I do? The marriage is to take place
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I give you my word I am nearly crazy, for
I love that girl better than my life."</p>

<p>Mr. Mole heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"I loved once," he said, "and my wife used to go
for my scalp, which had the effect of destroying love's
young dream."</p>

<p>"I should think so," replied Harvey.</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," exclaimed Jack, "you will
admit, I hope, that married life is the happiest state
of existence."</p>

<p>"I'll admit nothing."</p>

<p>"No happiness is to be found outside of the home
circle."</p>

<p>"It depends on a man's temperament, also on how
a man is brought up. A Philadelphian is happy at
home, a New Yorker is ignorant of the meaning of
the word 'Home,'" replied Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"Oh! pshaw," said Jack, impatiently. "Have
sense. Tell me if there is any bliss comparable to
that of having a sweet little darling always in the
house when you want her?"</p>

<p>"Suppose she is there when you do not want her?"</p>

<p>"I can not admit any such supposition. Go and
play your game."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"You and Maltravers ought to be in the same
game."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it is 'base.'"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the professor. "What have I done to
deserve this? You have called it 'base.' I must go
and get a 'ball' after that."</p>

<p>He walked to a closet in which he knew Jack kept
sundry bottles of wine and liquors, and helped himself
to a draught of brandy.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," he exclaimed, "I must leave you,
and you can bet your high monkey munk, as friend
Merrifield says, that I will do all that lays in my
power to uphold the honor of old England, and the
flag that for a thousand years has braved the battle
and the breeze."</p>

<p>Waving his arm grandly he quitted the apartment,
and making all his preparations, started for the place
appointed for the match.</p>

<p>The Blue Stockings were a pretty strong team and
had beaten the Reds the year previously, but it was
said the Reds had improved greatly, and a spirited
contest was expected.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole knew nothing whatever about the game,
but was wise enough to keep his mouth shut, until
he was spoken to.</p>

<p>His side lost the choice of innings and had to take
the field.</p>

<p>The professor became much interested in seeing
the men run from base to base, and did not look out
keenly enough.</p>

<p>What was the consequence?</p>

<p>A ball struck him with fearful force below the
knee.</p>

<p>He ought to have stopped it or caught it, but he
didn't, and he fell to the ground with a broken leg.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" he cried, "I'm killed."</p>

<p>Morris Hart ran up to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stop the ball?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It came so fast, I couldn't," groaned the unhappy
professor.</p>

<p>"I thought you were used to fast bowling and
could play the game."</p>

<p>"So I thought."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion you're a first-class fraud."</p>

<p>"Don't abuse me, there is a good fellow," said
Mole. "Send for an ambulance and have me taken
to the hospital: I'm in great pain and can't walk."</p>

<p>"If that is so, pardon me."</p>

<p>"My leg is broken."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I always knew it took an American
to play base-ball."</p>

<p>"Give me cricket," moaned Mr. Mole. "It is a
decent and respectable game. You don't want to
get your life insured before you engage in it."</p>

<p>Morris Hart could not refrain from smiling; but he
hurried away to get a conveyance which would take
Mr. Mole to the hospital.</p>

<p>He would have sent him to his hotel, but the professor
wished to have the best advice he could get,
and he knew he was sure of having excellent treatment
at a hospital.</p>

<p>Accordingly he was taken to a hospital in New
York and put to bed, when the surgeon set the
broken leg and assured him that in a few weeks he
would be able to get about again on crutches.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me," said Mole. "What a fool I
am getting in my old age. Here am I in a strange
country, and ought to have known better than to indulge
in the barbarous games of the people. Confound
base-ball and the man who invented it; but it
serves me right. I have no one but myself to
blame."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BAMBINO IN THE HOSPITAL.</p>


<p>Mr. Mole was in the accident ward, and many
poor wretches were sighing and groaning around
him.</p>

<p>In the next bed on the right-hand side was a man
who appeared in a comatose state.</p>

<p>Calling the nurse he said, "What is the matter
with that man there?"</p>

<p>"He is dying," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"It's a case of suicide. He was the Italian valet
of an English nobleman, they say."</p>

<p>"What is the nobleman's name?"</p>

<p>"Lord Maltravers."</p>

<p>Mr. Mole, at this announcement, gave a start
which nearly displaced the splints around his leg.</p>

<p>"Bambino!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>As he said this; the man in a dying condition looked
up with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>The mention of his name seemed to have aroused
him from the state of stupor into which he was
plunged.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am Bambino," he said, in a faint voice.
"Who calls me?"</p>

<p>"I," replied Mole.</p>

<p>"Who are you? My eyes are dim. I cannot see
you. All is a blank."</p>

<p>"A friend."</p>

<p>"What would you with me, friend?"</p>

<p>"Who shot you?"</p>

<p>This was a random question on the part of the professor,
but it touched the right chord.</p>

<p>"My master," replied Bambino, for it was he, and
Mr. Mole by a strange fatality had been placed in the
same ward and in the bed next to the scoundrel.</p>

<p>"Why did he shoot you?"</p>

<p>"Because he was going to marry a young lady in
New York and I told him he had a wife alive and
that it would be bigamy. I wanted money to keep
quiet and he would not give it me. Then I threatened
to produce the first wife, so he shot me."</p>

<p>The nurse was standing by, listening to the strange
conversation.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" inquired Mole.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she replied.</p>

<p>"Pay particular attention to it if you please, as it
is of the utmost importance to a friend of mine and
you will be required possibly as a witness."</p>

<p>"Who is this first wife?" pursued Mole, "and what
is her name?"</p>

<p>"A French woman, AdÃ©le Bellefontaine, living
with Madame Vesta Levine, the clairvoyant, in New
York city!"</p>

<p>The heavy lids fell down over the eyes and the
man lapsed into a state of semi-consciousness.</p>

<p>It was then about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>If the professor's leg had not been broken, he
would have got up and hastened to the Continental
Hotel to apprise Jack Harkaway of that which
would have been amply sufficient to stop the impending
marriage on the morrow between Lena
Van Hoosen and Lord Maltravers.</p>

<p>The next day they were to be married and if ever
that marriage took place, Jack's heart would be
broken.</p>

<p>Bambino's utterances were not the ravings of delirium,
far from it; he spoke coherently enough, and
had given sufficient information to enable Jack to stop the marriage.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le Bellefontaine&mdash;Madame Vesta Levine, the
clairvoyant&mdash;that was enough.</p>

<p>Surely there could be no difficulty in finding either or
both of them.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">JACK MAKES A LAST APPEAL.</p>


<p>It was the morning appointed for the marriage.</p>

<p>Harkaway was miserable and disconsolate.</p>

<p>He had not seen Mr. Mole since the day before, and
had only heard that he was hurt and had been taken
to the hospital.</p>

<p>So he said to Harvey: "Morris Hart tells me that
old Mole got his leg broken playing base-ball. I
suppose it is not very serious or we should have
heard from him. Won't you go and see him, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Harvey.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he gone, when Alfred Van Hoosen
came in. Jack eagerly grasped his hand.</p>

<p>"Will she see me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have sufficient influence over her to induce
her to do that," was the reply. "I have induced
her to consent to breakfast with us at the Brunswick."</p>

<p>They quitted the house together and Jack went on
to the Brunswick, while Alfred Van Hoosen engaged
a carriage to go to the house and bring his sister.</p>

<p>It was in a private room that Jack awaited their
coming. Slowly passed the minutes.</p>

<p>At length there was a rustle of silk, that indescribable
<i>frou-frou</i> which the skirts of a woman always
make, and Lena Van Hoosen, looking pale and with
traces of tears on her cheeks entered.</p>

<p>"Lena!" exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>She extended her hand which Jack grasped
warmly.</p>

<p>"I have come at the solicitation of my brother,"
she replied, "to bid you farewell."</p>

<p>"Forever?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought I owed this much to you, but I
wish it understood that we can only meet in future
as strangers.</p>

<p>"I am to be married to Lord Maltravers. It is
against my will, I admit that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Lena," interrupted her brother, passionately.
"You always professed some liking for me.
Why will you persist in this ill-advised match?"</p>

<p>"Simply because it is my duty. My mother insists
upon it. I sacrifice my inclination and my love."</p>

<p>It was evident from her manner and appearance
that the poor girl was suffering terribly.</p>

<p>"Is there no hope for me?" asked Jack, as he
choked back a sob.</p>

<p>"None," she answered in a stony voice. "Learn
to forget me."</p>

<p>"I cannot do it. I have every reason to believe
that I have been something to you. Can you so
easily forget me?"</p>

<p>She dared not look him in the face.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me," she said. "I have come at
your wish and my brother's to wish you farewell."</p>

<p>At this moment an organ in the street began to
play a funereal dirge, and it sounded like the knell of
all his hopes.</p>

<p>Alfred offered his arm to his sister and they passed
out together.</p>

<p>For some time Jack remained in an attitude of
passive despair, then he walked down-stairs.</p>

<p>In his preoccupied state, he did not see where he
was going, and in the corridor he pushed against a
man.</p>

<p>The man was Lord Maltravers who had come there
to breakfast.</p>

<p>"Harkaway," said his lordship.</p>

<p>"Yes, and your enemy," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I know it, my good fellow, and I'm proud of it."</p>

<p>"Don't call me your 'good fellow,'" said Jack,
while the blood rushed to his face.</p>

<p>"I shall call you what I please," exclaimed Lord
Maltravers, with cool insolence.</p>

<p>Jack controlled himself, and the two men stood
glaring at one another. Under no circumstances
can men hate so intensely as when they are rivals
for the affections of a woman.</p>

<p>"Isn't it about time, Mr. Harkaway, that you returned
to England?" said Lord Maltravers, with his
glass in his eye.</p>

<p>Jack gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p>"You are trying to insult me," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I hoped I had succeeded," was the reply.</p>

<p>"By Heaven you have," Jack cried, unable to control
himself any longer.</p>

<p>Clinching his broad sledge-hammer fist, he stepped
back a pace and dealt the peer a heavy blow in the
face.</p>

<p>Maltravers rolled over and fell on the floor.</p>

<p>Striding over his prostrate body with a contemptuous
air, Jack quitted the place.</p>

<p>When he reached home he found Harvey in the
hall.</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you, Jack," he said. "Had any
luck?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you persuade the lady that you were
better than that fellow Maltravers?"</p>

<p>"No. She would obey her mother."</p>

<p>"Never mind. There are as good fish in the sea,
as ever."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BRIDAL.</p>


<p>The day appointed for the marriage had at length
arrived, and Lena Van Hoosen was about as miserable
a girl as there was to be found in New York city.</p>

<p>With Lord Maltravers she could never be happy.
But she thought it her duty to sacrifice herself in
deference to the wishes of her mother.</p>

<p>The marriage was arranged to take place in Mrs.
Van Hoosen's house, at five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Only a few intimate friends of the family and some
relatives had been invited.</p>

<p>Alfred Van Hoosen at first refused to attend, but
Lena begged him not to keep away, and very reluctantly
he consented to be on hand.</p>

<p>At half-past five Lord Maltravers arrived and apologized
for the marks on his face by saying that
his horse had run away with him and that he had
been thrown in Central Park.</p>

<p>Lena paid very little attention to him, as he presented
her with some magnificent diamonds which
her mother placed around her neck and wrists,
but not even a smile illumined her countenance,
which was as pale as death.</p>

<p>At length the clergyman arrived, and as the clock
softly tinkled the hour of five, the couple took their
position, in front of him, and with open book he commenced
the ceremony.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Hoosen was delighted, for her ambitious
schemes now seemed on the verge of being realized.</p>

<p>Indeed she was the only person in the room, except
the guests, who seemed at all happy.</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers was restless and uneasy, looking
constantly toward the door, as if he feared some interruption
to the ceremony.</p>

<p>Alfred bit his lip and frowned, as he regarded Maltravers
with anything but a friendly air.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the clergyman read half a dozen lines
when there was a loud ring at the bell.</p>

<p>Maltravers started and Lena flushed visibly as if
she hoped against hope that something might happen
to interfere with this hateful marriage.</p>

<p>The minister went on with the ceremony.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a commotion in the hall, the
sound of footsteps was heard on the stairs, and Jack
Harkaway, hat in hand, appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>Halting on the threshold he said: "Pardon my
intrusion, ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>Lord Maltravers bridled up.</p>

<p>"You are an uninvited guest, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"I have taken the liberty of coming here to interrupt
this marriage."</p>

<p>Maltravers grew deathly pale.</p>

<p>"Are you aware, my good fellow," he exclaimed
insolently, "that you have rendered yourself liable
to be removed by the police?"</p>

<p>"Try it," answered Jack.</p>

<p>"Fortunately I provided against a contingency of
this kind and have a policeman stationed in the adjoining
apartment. If you do not instantly quit the
house, I shall&mdash;with Mrs. Van Hoosen's permission&mdash;tell
the officer to do his duty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Hoosen bowed her acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Allow me to ask the minister one question," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired the minister.</p>

<p>"Is it lawful for a man to have two wives?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Then I forbid this marriage to proceed, for Lord
Maltravers has a wife living."</p>

<p>"It is false," cried Maltravers.</p>

<p>"What proofs have you of this allegation?" inquired
the minister.</p>

<p>"The lady herself."</p>

<p>The next moment Harvey, with a lady leaning on
his arm, made his appearance.</p>

<p>The lady was AdÃ©le Bellefontaine.</p>

<p>"Here is your wife, my lord," exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>AdÃ©le no sooner saw Maltravers than, clouded
though her intellect was, she recognized him.</p>

<p>Rushing forward she fell on her knees and grasped
his unwilling hand.</p>

<p>"Oh! do not spurn me from you," she cried. "I
am your wife in the sight of God and man and Heaven
knows I have always loved you dearly."</p>

<p>"You are an impostor," replied Maltravers.</p>

<p>"No, no. You cared for me once."</p>

<p>"Away!"</p>

<p>"I will not. This time you shall not drive me from
you."</p>

<p>Harkaway stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Will you call your policeman now?" he asked.</p>

<p>His lordship glared at him with bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>"Who killed Bambino?" persisted Jack.</p>

<p>Maltravers staggered as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Jack, "<i>Bambino has spoken</i>! His
confession and accusation against you were taken
down by a judge. A warrant is already out for
your arrest on the charge of murder, for he died this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Suddenly Maltravers drew a pistol from his
pocket. "Stand back," he exclaimed. "I will not
be taken alive."</p>

<p>He attempted to gain the door, but AdÃ©le clung to
his hand. "Do not leave me," she plead.</p>

<p>Depressing the muzzle of his pistol he placed it
near her head.</p>

<p>In the struggle that ensued, the pistol exploded,
and AdÃ©le fell to the floor, shot dead.</p>

<p>Maltravers ran from the room and by his knowledge
of the premises succeeded in making an effective escape.
The police quickly came, but they were
wholly baffled, and though every step was taken to
catch the murderer and impostor he disappeared
as utterly as if no such man had existed.</p>

<p>It was a sad release from life for the poor, neglected
wife, but, better that than the misery of living as
she had been. She was buried by kindly hands and
sympathetic tears were shed at her grave.</p>

<p>Lena, under the inspiration of Jack's presence,
soon recovered her good spirits and in due time became
a willing bride and the most loved of wives.</p>

<p>And so Jack Harkaway's career in New York
culminated in Jack Harkaway's happiness.</p>
